<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<hr class="hr2"/>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;x]</span></p>

<p class="cap">THERE are as many possible biographies of a man as
there are possible biographers&mdash;and one more! Of
Lafcadio Hearn there has been, and there will be, no excuse
for any biography whatever. A properly edited volume of
his letters, and, perhaps, a critical estimate of the methods
and development of his imaginative power and literary
character are, and still remain, most desirable. That some
competent hand may yet be found to undertake this task
is still hoped by those who recognize the value of a man's
best work. To furnish material and help toward this end
is my object in collecting the following pages. The life
of a literary man interests and is of value to the world
because of the literature he has created. Without a bibliography,
without even mention of the works he wrote, his
biography would be useless. To correct many untrue and
misleading statements and inferences of a serious nature
that have been published concerning him and his life,
should it ever be undertaken, will prove a labour so difficult
and thankless that it will scarcely be entered upon by one
who would do it rightly. That it will not be hazarded comes,
as I have said, from the fact that it is not needed, because
neither Hearn himself, nor his real friends, nor again, a discriminating
literary sense, have been, nor can be, under
any illusion as to his "greatness." He has been spoken of
as "a great man," which, of course, he was not. Two talents
he had, but these were far from constituting personal
greatness. Deprived by nature, by the necessities of his
life, or by conscious intention, of religion, morality, scholarship,
magnanimity, loyalty, character, benevolence, and
other constituents of personal greatness, it is more than
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;xi]</span>
folly to endeavour to place him thus wrongly before the
world.</p>

<p class="indent">The irony of the situation is pathetically heightened by
the fact that, supposing him to be very great, "the weaknesses
of very great men," which he said should not be
spoken of, are amazingly paraded in the letters. Had he
ever dreamed that his letters would be published, he would
not, and could not, have so unblushingly exposed himself
and his faults to the public gaze. The fact has now been
writ exceeding large, or it would not be, and should
not be, corrected and contradicted. A word to the wise
suffices.</p>

<p class="indent">There remains the question, truly pertinent, concerning
the nature and progress toward perfection of his imagination,
and of his literary execution.</p>

<p class="indent">We know nothing, and doubtless we may never know
anything definite, accurate and of value about the character
either of his father or of his mother. Any attempt, therefore,
to estimate what effect heredity had in handing
down the strange endowment we find in his early manhood
is wholly futile. We may not be too sure concerning either
the parentage or nationality ascribed to him.</p>

<p class="indent">Moreover, in the last analysis, Hearn was no "product
of his environment." In a certain sense, he was of the
school of Flaubert, Gautier, Maupassant, Loti, and Zola,
but with such differences and variations that these teachers
may not take much credit or flattery to themselves. The
great, the distinctive, the dominating force which controlled
and created Hearn's literary makings, his morbid vision,
was not "environment" as the critics and scientists mean
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;xii]</span>
by the term. These have not yet learned that Art and
Life hang upon the perfection and peculiarities of the
senses of the artist and of the one who lives, and that
intellect and especially æsthetics are almost wholly the
product of vision. Conversely, the morbidities and individualisms
of Art and Life often depend pre-eminently
upon the morbidities of vision.</p>

<p class="indent">Character, lastly, is the action or reaction of personality
against circumstance, not under and dominated by circumstance.
To have character is to control circumstance;
Hearn was always its slave. Except in one particular, the
pursuit of literary excellence, Hearn had no character
whatever. His was the most unresisting, most echolike
mind I have ever known. He was a perfect chameleon;
he took for the time the colour of his surroundings. He
was always the mirror of the friend of the instant, or if
no friend was there, of the dream of that instant. The
next minute he was another being, acted upon by the new
circumstance, reflecting the new friend, or redreaming the
old and new-found dream. They who blame him too
sharply for his disloyalty and ingratitude to old friends
do not understand him psychologically. There was
nothing behind the physical and neurologic machine
to be loyal or disloyal. He had no mind, or character,
to be possessed of loyalty or disloyalty. For the most
part, he simply dropped his friends, and rarely spoke
ill of them or of his enemies. There was nothing whatever
in him, except perhaps for the short time when
he said his friend had given him a soul, to take the cast
and function of loyalty or disloyalty, gratitude or ingratitude.
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;xiii]</span>
One does not ask originality or even great consistency
of an echo, and, of all men that have ever lived,
Hearn, mentally and spiritually, was most perfectly an echo.
The sole quality, the only originality, he brought to the
fact, or to the echo, was colour&mdash;a peculiar derivation of a
maimed sense. He created or invented nothing; his
stories were always told him by others; at first they were
gruesome tales even to horror and disgust. He learned
by practice to choose lovelier stories, ones always distant,
sometimes infinitely distant, and he learned to retell or
echo them with more artistic skill and even a matchless
grace. His merit, almost his sole merit, and his unique
skill lay in the strange faculty of colouring the echo with
the hues and tints of heavenly rainbows and unearthly
sunsets, all gleaming with a ghostly light that never was
on sea or shore. So that, fused as he was with his work,
he himself became that impossible thing, a chromatic voice,
a multicoloured echo.</p>

<p class="indent">We must, therefore, accept the facts as we find them,
the young man as we find him, uneducated, friendless,
without formed character, with a lot of heathenish and
unrestrained appetites, crippled as to the most important
of the senses, poverty-stricken, improvident, of peculiar and
unprepossessing appearance and manners, flung into an
alien world in many ways more morbid than himself.
That he lived at all is almost astonishing, and that he
writhed out, how he did it, and the means whereby he
finally presented to the best artistic and literary intellects
of the world prized values and enjoyments, is indeed
worthy of some attention and study.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;xiv]</span>
From letters written to me just prior to his death by
that veteran and discriminating critic, Mr. Edmund C.
Stedman, I quote a few sentences to show that the
appreciation of Hearn has by no means reached its full
measure:</p>

<p class="indent">"I passed an evening with your Hearn manuscript and
the supplementary matter by my granddaughter, and
found them both well done and of deep interest. Some of
your passages are beautifully written and make me think
that if you will give us more of the style which is so
plainly at your command, you will gain, etc.... The
publishers do not understand, as I do, that Hearn will in
time be as much of a romantic personality and tradition as
Poe now is. I strongly urged one publisher to buy those
copyrights owned by three other firms on any terms and
in the end bring out a definitive edition of his complete
works."</p>

<p class="indent">As to Miss Stedman's workmanlike bibliography, it
should be said that the rule which has been followed in
excluding less valuable reviews and notices, was based
upon the effort to include doubtful ones only when of
exceptional value, by a personal friend of Hearn, etc.
Files of ordinary newspapers are not preserved even in
local libraries, and, therefore, references to them have
been excluded except under peculiar circumstances of
authorship, opinions stated, etc.</p>

<p class="indent">For their kind permission to make extracts from Hearn's
published works, grateful acknowledgments are due to
Messrs. Little, Brown and Company, Houghton, Mifflin and
Company, Harper Brothers, and The Macmillan Company.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;xv]</span>
Should this volume bring in more money than the necessary
expenses of compiling it, the excess will be sent to
Mrs. Hearn through the Japanese Consul, or in some other
way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;2]</span></p>

<p class="cap">MANY conflicting accounts have been given concerning
Hearn's parents and childhood. From his
own statements made in 1889, the notes of which, taken
down at the moment, are before me, he was born on
June 27, 1850, at Leucadia, in Santa Maura, one of the
Ionian Islands. His father, he said, was an Irishman,
Charles Bush Hearn, Surgeon-Major in the 76th English
Infantry Regiment, which had been stationed at Madras,
Calcutta. The regiment was later merged into the 22nd
West Riding Battalion. His mother was a Greek from
Cerigo, another of the Ionian Isles; her name he had
forgotten. He spoke of his father and mother as having
been married, and of a subsequent divorce, about 1857 or
1858. Allusion was made to a younger brother, named
Daniel, who was brought up by an artist, a painter, Richard
Hearn, a brother of Charles Bush Hearn, who lived in
Paris.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Hearn thought this brother was educated as a
civil engineer. After the divorce his mother remarried,
her second husband being a lawyer, a Greek, name unknown,
and living at Smyrna, Asia Minor. Lafcadio's
father also remarried, taking his wife to India. Three
daughters were said to have been born there. Lafcadio
was put under the care of his aunt, Mrs. Sarah Brenane, of
Dublin, No. 73 Upper Leeson Street. She was a widow
without children. In a letter to me, written prior to 1889,
Hearn says: "As for me, I have a good deal in me <i>not</i> to
thank my ancestors for; and it is a pleasure that <i>I cannot</i>,
even if I would, trace myself two generations back, not
even one generation on my mother's side. Half these
Greeks are mixed with Turks and Arabs&mdash;don't know
how much of an Oriental mixture I have, or may have."
And again, "I do not know anything about my mother,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;3]</span>
whether alive or dead. My father died on his return from
India. There was a queer romance in the history of my
mother's marriage." He told me later that this romance
was said to have been that Surgeon-Major Hearn was
once set upon by the brothers of the young Greek woman
to whom he was paying attention, and that he was left
supposedly dead, with about a score of dagger-made
wounds in his body.</p>

<a href="#FNanchor_1_1">
<span class="label">[1]</span></a>
In <i>The Bookbuyer</i>, May, 1896, Hearn's friend, Mr. J. S. Tunison,
speaks of the existence of a brother, "a busy farmer in Northwestern
Ohio."</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">In the Dayton, Ohio, <i>Journal</i>, of December 25, 1906,
Mr. Tunison speaks authoritatively of the discrepant
accounts given by many writers, and by Hearn himself,
concerning his parents, birth and early years. "Hearn
himself had misgivings, and sometimes associated his
baptismal name with the not uncommon Spanish name,
Leocadie." The boy, of course, could only repeat what
he had been told by his relatives or friends. Physiognomy
can help little perhaps, but here its testimony is assuredly
not confirmatory of the more common story. Any attempt
to secure definite information in Ireland would scarcely be
successful. One possibility remained: There is still living
an Irish gentleman to whom Lafcadio was sent from
Ireland, and in whose care, at least to a limited extent,
the boy was placed. I have not the right to mention his
name. He was living in Cincinnati, Ohio, in 1870, and
through his brother-in-law in Ireland, Lafcadio was, as it
were, consigned to my informant. The subject is an
unpleasant one to him, and he answered my questions
with reluctance. He did not like the boy and did not
feel that he had any obligation toward him; in fact, he
did not feel that he was in any way responsible for his
care. Besides, he had heavy duties toward his own
children that absorbed all his energies. "I never had
a letter from him. He came to the house three times.
Mrs. Brenane sent me money, which I gave to him to pay
his bills with. When he got work, he never came near me
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;4]</span>
again." He was not sure that Mrs. Brenane was, in truth,
Hearn's aunt, and upon being pressed, answered repeatedly,
"I know nothing, nobody knows anything true of Hearn's
life. He may have been related to my wife's family, but I
never knew." Asked why the lad was "shipped" to him,
he replied, "I do not know." Inquiries concerning the
boy's schooling brought no more than, "I only know that
he could never stay long in one school." "His father was
Irish, was he not?" "Yes." "And his mother was
Greek?" "O yes, I suppose so," but with an indefinite
inflection.</p>

<p class="indent">The mystery, therefore, of Hearn's parentage and boyhood
years is probably not to be cleared up. He was,
perhaps, a "bad boy," and expelled from several schools;
his lifelong hatred and fear of Catholics and Jesuits doubtless
dates from these youthful and irrational experiences;
but it is useless to inquire whether or not they were in any
sense justifiable. A little reflected light is thrown upon
this period by an apocryphal anecdote in a letter to me,
written while Hearn was at my house, and which Miss
Bisland in her "Life and Letters" kindly failed to put in
its proper place,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> as well as omitted to say whence she
obtained it:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">This again reminds me of something. When I was a boy, I had to
go to confession, and my confessions were honest ones. One day I
told the ghostly father that I had been guilty of desiring that the devil
would come to me in the shape of the beautiful woman in which he
came to the Anchorites in the desert, and that I thought that I would
yield to such temptations. He was a grim man who rarely showed
emotion, my confessor, but on that occasion he actually rose to his
feet in anger.</p>

<p class="indent">"Let me warn you!" he cried, "let me warn you! Of all things
never wish that! You might be more sorry for it than you can possibly
believe!"</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;5]</span>
His earnestness filled me with fearful joy;&mdash;for I thought the temptation
might actually be realized&mdash;so serious he looked ... but the
pretty <i>succubi</i> all continued to remain in hell.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">The necessary inference, therefore, is that the lad was an
unwelcome charge upon those Irish relations or friends of
his father, in whose care he was placed. It is said that he
always spoke with bitterness of his father, and with love of
his mother. Beyond a certain amount of money allotted
(by his father?) for his support, neither parent was evidently
concerned about his upbringing and welfare, and all who
should have been interested in those things made haste to
rid themselves of the obligations. If the stories of his
boyish "badness" were true, the lad could not be blamed
for putting into practice his inherited instincts, so that the
pathos of his early misfortunes only increase our sympathy
for the youth and his tragedies. (I reproduce a photograph
of Lafcadio and his aunt, Mrs. Justin, or Sarah, Brenane.
The lad must have been at the time about eight years of
age.) The "consignment" of the nineteen-year old youth
to the distant relative of the family, who was then living in
Cincinnati, explains the reason why, landing in New York,
he finally went to Cincinnati. How long he lived in New
York City and any details of his life there before he went
West, may be held as beyond investigation. Mr. Tunison
incidentally speaks of him during this time as "sleeping in
dry-goods boxes on the street, etc.," and I have heard that
he acted as a restaurant waiter. There have been published
stories of a period of want and suffering endured in London
before the emigration to New York City. Others concerning
great scholarship and the intimate knowledge of several
languages, especially French, are surely not true. Even in
1889, after the New Orleans and Martinique periods, Hearn
could not speak French with ease or correctness. In
Cincinnati he secured the help of a French scholar in
translating Gautier's "Émaux et Camées." His want of
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;6]</span>
knowledge of the Latin language is deplored in his letters
and, to the last, after a dozen or more years in Japan,
his inability to read a Japanese newspaper or speak the
language was a source of regret to himself, of errors too
numerous to mention, and of grievous limitations in his
work as an interpreter. In the one field of which his
taste, aptitude and function dictated a wide and stimulating
acquaintance, folk-lore, he was lamentably wanting.
It might seem unfitting to allude to this were it not well
to be discriminating in all cases, and had not Hearn sought
to reach authoritativeness in a department wherein he had
not gathered the fundamental data.</p>

<hr class="hr2"/>

<p class="cap"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;8]</span>WHEN, in 1889, Hearn appeared in my reception
room, although I had not seen any photograph of
him, and had not even known of his coming, I at once said,
"You are Lafcadio?" The poor exotic was so sadly out
of place, so wondering, so suffering and shy, that I am sure
he would have run out of the house if I had not at once
shown him an overflowing kindness, or if a tone of voice
had betrayed any curiosity or doubt. It was at once
agreed that he should stay with me for awhile, and there
was no delay in providing him with a seat at my table and
a room where he could be at his work of proof-correcting.
His "Two Years in the French West Indies" was then
going through the press, and an incident connected with
the proof-reading illustrates how impossible it was for him,
except when necessity drove, to meet any person not already
known. He wished to give his reader the tune of the songs
printed on pages 426-431, but he knew nothing of music.
I arranged with a lady to repeat the airs on her piano as
he should whistle them, and then to write them on the
music-staff. When the fatal evening arrived, Hearn and I
went to the lady's house, but as we proceeded his part in
our chatting lapsed into silence, and he lagged behind.
Although he finally dragged himself to the foot of the doorstep,
after I had rung the bell, his courage failed, and before
the door was opened I saw him running as if for life, half a
square away!</p>

<p class="indent">Even before this adventure I had learned that it was
useless to try to get him to lunch or dinner if any stranger
were present. I think he always listened to detect the
possible presence of a stranger before entering the dining-room,
and he would certainly have starved rather than
submit to such an ordeal. It may be readily imagined that
my attempt to secure his services as a lecturer before a
local literary society was a ludicrous failure. He would
have preferred hanging.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;9]</span>
I allude to this attitude of his mind from no idle or
curious reason, but because it arose from logical and
necessary reasons. When, later, he was in Japan, I was
once importuned, and should not have yielded, to give a
friend, who was about to visit T&#333;ky&#333;, a note of introduction.
As I warned my friend Hearn refused to see visitors.</p>

<p class="indent">That his extreme shyness depended upon his being
unknown, and that it was united to a lack of humour, may
be gathered from the fact that, when he came from Martinique,
he wore a clothing which inevitably made the
passers-by turn and look and smile. Long and repeated
endeavours were necessary before I could get his consent to
lay aside the outrageous tropical hat for one that would not
attract attention. How little he recked of this appears from
the tale I heard that a lot of street gamins in Philadelphia
formed a <i>queue</i>, the leader holding by Hearn's coat-tails,
and, as they marched, all kept step and sang in time,
"Where, where, where did you get that hat?"</p>

<p class="indent">At once, upon first meeting Hearn, I instinctively recognized
that upon my part the slightest sign of a desire or
attempt to study him, to look upon him as an object of
literary or "natural" history, would immediately put an
end to our relations. Indeed, it never at that time entered
my mind to think thus of him, and only since collections of
his letters and biographies are threatened has it occurred to
me to think over our days and months together, and to
help, so far as advisable, toward a true understanding of
the man and his art.</p>

<p class="indent">In 1889 Lafcadio was 5 feet 3 inches tall, weighed
137 pounds, and had a chest girth of 36-3/4 inches.</p>

<p class="indent">The summer of 1889 made noteworthy changes in
Hearn's character. I suspect it was his first experience in
anything that might be called home-life. To his beloved
<i>pays des revenants</i>, Martinique, his mind constantly reverted,
with an <i>Ahnung</i> that he should never see it again. There
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;10]</span>
are truth and pathos and keen self-knowledge, frankly expressed
in the letters he would write me in the next room,
immediately after we had chatted long together, and when
he felt that the pen could better express what he shyly
shrank from speaking:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">Ah! to have a profession is to be rich, to have international current-money,
a gold that is cosmopolitan, passes everywhere. Then I think
I would never settle down in any place; would visit all, wander about
as long as I could. There is such a delightful pleasantness about the
<i>first</i> relations with people in strange places&mdash;before you have made
any rival, excited any ill wills, incurred anybody's displeasure. Stay
long enough in any one place and the illusion is over; you have to sift
this society through the meshes of your nerves, and find perhaps one
good friendship too large to pass through.</p>

<p class="indent">It is a very beautiful world; the ugliness of some humanity only
exists as the shadowing that outlines the view; the nobility of man
and the goodness of woman can only be felt by those who know the
possibilities of degradation and corruption. Philosophically I am
simply a follower of Spencer, whose mind gives me the greatest conception
of Divinity I can yet expand to receive. The faultiness is not
with the world, but with myself. I inherit certain susceptibilities,
weaknesses, sensitivenesses, which render it impossible to adapt myself
to the ordinary <i>milieu</i>; I have to make one of my own wherever
I go, and never mingle with that already made. True, I love much
knowledge, but I escape pains which, in spite of all your own knowledge,
you could wholly comprehend, for the simple reason that you
<i>can</i> mingle with men.</p>

<p class="indent">I am really quite lonesome for you, and am reflecting how much
more lonesome I shall be in some outrageous equatorial country where
I shall not see you any more;&mdash;also it seems to me perfectly and inexplainably
atrocious to know that some day or other there will be no
Gooley at &mdash;&mdash; St. That I should cease to make a shadow some day
seems quite natural, because Hearney boy is only a bubble anyhow
("The earth hath bubbles"),&mdash;but you, hating mysteries and seeing
and feeling and knowing everything,&mdash;you have no right ever to die at
all. And I can't help doubting whether you will. You have almost
made me believe what you do not believe yourself: that there are
souls. I haven't any, I know; but I think you have,&mdash;something
electrical and luminous inside you that will walk about and see things
always. Are you really&mdash;what I see of you&mdash;only an Envelope of
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;11]</span>
something subtler and perpetual? Because if you are, I might want
you to pass down some day southward,&mdash;over the blue zone and the
volcanic peaks like a little wind,&mdash;and flutter through the palm-plumes
under the all-putrefying sun,&mdash;and reach down through old roots to
the bones of me, and try to raise me up....</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">The weakness and even exhaustion which the West
Indian climate had wrought in Hearn were painfully apparent.
His stay in Philadelphia, warm as that summer
was to us, brought him speedily back to physical health.
The lesson was not unheeded, nor its implications, by his
sensitive mind.</p>

<p class="indent">I reproduce two photographs of Hearn: the first taken in
1888 (facing page 61); and the second, by Mr. Gutekunst,
at my urgent solicitation, in 1889, while Hearn was stopping
at my house (<i>Frontispiece</i>).</p>

<p class="indent">The first photograph, taken in Martinique, brings out
the habitual sadness and lack of vivacity in his physiognomy.
In my picture of 1889 (the second) I was
unable, despite all effort, to get Hearn to present to
the camera his entire face with naturally open eyes, and
the customary expression. He resolutely refused, and
consented to the compromise of a two-thirds view <i>with
closed eyes</i>. And this to me is still the most truthful and
hence the most expressive of all his photographs. It is so
suggestive because of its negations, so expressive because
non-expressive. But it indicates, silently and by inference,
the most significant fact about the man.</p>

<p class="indent">To those who are expert in such things, the stare of the
highly myopic eye is known to be not that of mental action
and seeing, but of not seeing. When we walk, we are forward-looking
beings, and what goes on within the eye or
brain and what may be behind us is totally ignored. But
for a highly myopic person there is no outward or forward
looking. Hearn's closed eye gives, therefore, a decidedly
more truthful lesson in physiognomy than does the open
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;12]</span>
and protruding one, which cannot see the coming or future
scene, or which sees it so vaguely that its hint of the scene
is perhaps more useless than the imagined picture of the
totally blind. His inability to see the presenting world
had resulted in a renunciation of outlook and an absolute
incuriosity as to the future. With weaklings this might
have brought about introspection, the mental eye&mdash;the
product of the physical eye&mdash;turned in upon itself. Hearn
was too much of an artist to fall into that Death Valley of
all æsthetics, and there was a quick acceptance of the
logical and inevitable, whence arose the wonder of poetic
retrospection.</p>

WHEN Hearn arrived in Cincinnati, in 1871 or
1872, he was twenty-one or twenty-two years
of age. All other methods of making a livelihood
except that by his pen had failed, or were soon to fail, and
it is not long before the literary way is exclusively and
permanently adopted. There was a brief first time of
service with Robert Clarke and Company as proof-reader.
The exact uses of punctuation, the clearness which the
proper marks give to writing, soon earned for him the
sobriquet "Old Semicolon" among his fellow reporters.
All his life Hearn clung meticulously to his theories
concerning the necessity and precise rules of punctuation.
Some of his later quarrels with periodical editors and
proof-readers arose from differences of opinion in these
things. There was a short engagement of Hearn by the
librarian, Mr. Thomas Vickers, as private secretary or
helper. Among his early friends was a printer, Mr. Henry
Watkin, now residing at 1312 McMillan Street, who was
kind to him, and who taught him to set type.</p>

<p class="indent">"In 1874," Mr. O. P. Caylor<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> writes, "Col. Cockerill of
the <i>World</i> was managing editor of the Cincinnati <i>Enquirer</i>.
A few weeks previous to the 'Tan-Yard Murder' Mr.
Hearn came to the <i>Enquirer</i> office to sell a manuscript.
Upstairs he ventured, but there his courage failed him.
It was not enough to induce him to brave the awful
editorial presence. So he paced up and down the hall
with his velvet restless tread until the awful door opened
and the terrible giant came forth. Hearn would, no doubt,
have run away had he not been at the rear of the hall
when Mr. Cockerill came out into the other end, and the
stairway was between.</p>

<a href="#FNanchor_3_3">
<span class="label">[3]</span></a> A quotation in the <i>Author</i>, January 15, 1890, from an article by
Mr. Caylor in the Philadelphia <i>North American</i>.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">"Thus it occurred that the author of 'Chita' submitted
his first manuscript. He came with others later, but never
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;15]</span>
could he persuade himself to knock at that editorial door
for admission. Up and down, up and down the hall he
would pace or glide until Colonel Cockerill came forth,
whether the time consumed in waiting was ten minutes
or two hours."</p>

<p class="indent">In <i>Current Literature</i>, June, 1896, Colonel John A.
Cockerill, writing of Hearn, tells the story thus:</p>

<p class="indent">"Some twenty years ago I was the editor in charge of a
daily newspaper in a Western city. One day there came
to my office a quaint, dark-skinned little fellow, strangely
diffident, wearing glasses of great magnifying power and
bearing with him evidence that Fortune and he were scarce
on nodding terms.</p>

<p class="indent">"In a soft, shrinking voice he asked if I ever paid for
outside contributions. I informed him that I was somewhat
restricted in the matter of expenditure, but that I
would give consideration to what he had to offer. He
drew from under his coat a manuscript, and tremblingly
laid it upon my table. Then he stole away like a distorted
brownie, leaving behind him an impression that was uncanny
and indescribable.</p>

<p class="indent">"Later in the day I looked over the contribution which he
had left. I was astonished to find it charmingly written....</p>

<p class="indent">"He sat in the corner of my room and wrote special
articles for the Sunday edition as thoroughly excellent as
anything that appeared in the magazines of those days. I
have known him to have twelve and fifteen columns of this
matter in a single issue of the paper. He was delighted
to work, and I was pleased to have him work, for his style
was beautiful and the tone he imparted to the newspaper
was considerable. Hour after hour he would sit at his
table, his great bulbous eyes resting as close to the paper
as his nose would permit, scratching away with beaver-like
diligence and giving me no more annoyance than a bronze
ornament.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;16]</span>
"His eyes troubled him greatly in those days. He was
as sensitive as a flower. An unkind word from anybody
was as serious to him as a cut from a whiplash, but I do
not believe he was in any sense resentful.... He was
poetic, and his whole nature seemed attuned to the beautiful,
and he wrote beautifully of things which were neither
wholesome nor inspiring. He came to be in time a
member of the city staff at a fair compensation, and it was
then that his descriptive powers developed. He loved to
write of things in humble life. He prowled about the dark
corners of the city, and from gruesome places he dug out
charming idyllic stories. The negro stevedores on the
steamboat-landings fascinated him. He wrote of their
songs, their imitations, their uncouth ways, and he found
picturesqueness in their rags, poetry in their juba dances."</p>

<p class="indent">In January or February, 1874, there was a horrible
murder, "the famous Tan-Yard case," in Cincinnati, and
Hearn's account of it in the <i>Enquirer</i>, from the newspaper
and reportorial standpoint was so graphic and so far
beyond the power of all rivals that he was henceforth
assured of employment and of a measure and kind of
respect. His friend, Mr. Edward Henderson, formerly city
editor of the <i>Commercial</i>, now City Clerk in Cincinnati,
says that because of his startling report of this murder
"his city editors kept him at the most arduous work of a
daily morning paper&mdash;the night-stations, for in that field
mostly developed the sensational events that were worthy
of his pen. In these days his powers would be held in
reserve to write up what others should discover.... His
repertory was strongest in the unusual and the startling.
He was never known to shirk hardship or danger in filling
an assignment or following up his self-obtained pointer."</p>

<p class="indent">The beginning of Hearn's literary career was his report
of the Tan-Yard Murder case. It was published in the
Cincinnati <i>Enquirer</i>, November, 1874. I shall quote some
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;17]</span>
parts of it in a footnote to illustrate his innate and studied
ability to outfit with words and expressions of the most
startling and realistic picturing quality, the most horrible
and loathsome facts. Keeping in mind the comparison
with the illustrations from his later work in which he was
equally capable of painting noble and beautiful things (all
except those of a spiritual or religious nature), one is filled
with admiration of a faculty so rare and perfect. Those
who are sensitive should not read the excerpts which I
append, and which are given in obedience to a sense of
duty.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<span class="label">[4]</span></a> "An <i>Enquirer</i> reporter visited the establishment some hours later,
accompanied by Dr. Maley, and examined all so far discovered of
Herman Schilling's charred corpse. The hideous mass of reeking
cinders, despite all the efforts of the brutal murderers to hide their
ghastly crime, remain sufficiently intact to bear frightful evidence
against them.</p>

<p class="indent">"On lifting the coffin-lid, a powerful and penetrating odour, strongly
resembling the smell of burnt beef, yet heavier and fouler, filled the
room and almost sickened the spectators. But the sight of the black
remains was far more sickening. Laid upon the clean white lining of
the coffin, they rather resembled great shapeless lumps of half-burnt
bituminous coal than aught else at the first hurried glance; and only
a closer investigation could enable a strong-stomached observer to
detect their ghastly character&mdash;masses of crumbling human bones,
strung together by half-burnt sinews, or glued one upon another by a
hideous adhesion of half-molten flesh, boiled brains and jellied blood,
mingled with coal.</p>

<p class="indent">"The skull had burst like a shell in the fierce furnace heat, and the
whole upper portion seemed as though it had been blown out by the
steam from the boiling and bubbling brains. Only the posterior
portion of the occipital and parietal bones, and the inferior and
superior maxillary, and some of the face bones remained,&mdash;the upper
portion of the skull bones being jagged, burnt brown in some spots,
and in others charred to black ashes. The brain had all boiled away,
save a small waste lump at the base of the skull about the size of a
lemon. It was crisped and still warm to the touch. On pushing the
finger through the crisp, the interior felt about the consistency of
banana fruit, and the yellow fibre seemed to writhe like worms in the
Coroner's hands. The eyes were cooked to bubbled crisps in the
blackened sockets, and the bones of the nose were gone, leaving a
hideous hole.</p>

<p class="indent">"So covered were the jaws and the lower facial bones with coal,
crusted blood and gummy flesh, that the Coroner at first supposed
that the lower maxillary had been burned away. On tearing away the
frightful skull-mask of mingled flesh and coal and charred gristle,
however, the grinning teeth shone ghastly white, and the jaws were
found intact. They were set together so firmly that it was found
impossible to separate them, without reducing the whole mass to
ashes. So great had been the heat that the Coroner was able to
crumble one of the upper teeth in his fingers.</p>

<p class="indent">"Besides the fragments of the skull, have been found six ribs of the
right side and four of the left; the middle portion of the spinal-column;
the liver, spleen, and kidneys; the pelvic bones, the right
and left humerus, the femoral bone and the tibia and fibula of both
legs. The body had burnt open at the chest, and the heart and lungs
had been entirely consumed. The liver had been simply roasted and
the kidneys fairly fried. There is a horrible probability that the
wretched victim was forced into the furnace alive, and suffered all the
agonies of the bitterest death man can die, while wedged in the flaming
flue. The teeth were so terribly clinched that more than one spectator
of the hideous skull declared that only the most frightful agony could
have set those jaws together. Perhaps, stunned and disabled by the
murderous blows of his assailants, the unconscious body of the poor
German was forced into the furnace. Perhaps the thrusts of the
assassin's pitchfork, wedging him still further into the fiery hell, or
perhaps the first agony of burning when his bloody garments took
fire, revived him to meet the death of flames. Fancy the shrieks for
mercy, the mad expostulation, the frightful fight for life, the superhuman
struggle for existence&mdash;a century of agony crowded into a
moment&mdash;the shrieks growing feebler&mdash;the desperate struggle dying
into feeble writhings. And through it all, the grim murderers,
demoniacally pitiless, devilishly desperate, gasping with their exertions
to destroy a poor human life, looking on in silent triumph, peering
into the furnace until the skull exploded, and the steaming body
burst, and the fiery flue hissed like a hundred snakes! It may not be
true&mdash;we hope for humanity's sake it cannot be true; but the rightful
secrets of that fearful night are known only to the criminals and their
God. They may be brought to acknowledge much; but surely never
so much as we have dared to hint at."</p>

"When his city editor, in compliance with the urgency
of a steeple-climber, consented to send a reporter to take
observations of the city from the top of the cross surmounting
the spire of St. Peter's Cathedral in Cincinnati, Hearn
was the man selected. In mentioning the assignment to
him, the city editor handed him a valuable field-glass, with
the suggestion that he might find it useful. On taking his
departure with the climbers, Hearn quietly handed back
the glasses with the remark in undertone, 'Perhaps I'd
better not take these; something might happen.' He made
the trip to the top of the spire, though the men found it
necessary to haul him part of the way in mid-air and to
bodily place and hold him on top of the cross. And he
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;19]</span>

<span class="label">[5]</span></a> Our wonder at the performance is heightened by the fact that
Hearn, of course, saw nothing of what he so vividly described.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">It is little wonder that his "Vocabulary of the Gruesome"
became famous, since I have learned from his friend
and associate, the artist, Mr. Farney, and also from others,
certain facts which demonstrate that this vocabulary was
gathered not only or chiefly because of the exigencies of
his work as a reporter, or to express the revolting in thrilling
words, but because he had a spontaneous lickerishness for
the things themselves. He positively delighted in the gruesome.
With his fingers he dug into the scorched flesh and
the exuding brains of the murdered man's body when it
was taken from the furnace, and in another murder case he
slid on the floor, as if on ice, in the congealed blood of the
victim. "He even drank blood at the abattoirs with the
consumptives when that craze had fallen upon the people
of Cincinnati." There is more than an excuse for mentioning
these things; it is necessary to do so in order to
understand the origin and transformation of Hearn's chief
endowment as a writer.</p>

<p class="indent">Even more convincing, perhaps, than these offensive
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;20]</span>
gloatings as regards his native love of the gruesome, is
the unconscious testimony given in the history of an
illustrated paper established by Mr. Farney and Mr.
Hearn. Mr. Henderson has said of Hearn that "very
rarely was he known to throw a <i>soupçon</i> of humour into
his work." The newspaper venture demonstrates that
even when humour was planned Hearn had none to give.</p>

in Cincinnati, Ohio, on June 21, 1874, and describes itself
on the title-page as, "A Weekly Illustrated Journal,
Devoted to Art, Literature and Satire." The size of the
pages was 14-1/2 × 10-3/4 inches. The subsequent issues were
larger, about 16 × 11-1/4 inches. There were eight pages in
each number, the first, third, fourth and eighth were
illustrated by Mr. H. F. Farney; the others were made up
of reading matter. The heading of the editorial page did
not exactly repeat that of the title-page, but read as
follows:</p>

<p class="cnobmargin">"The Giglampz."</p>
<p class="cnomargins">Published Daily, except Week-Days.</p>
<p class="cnomargins">Terms, $2.50 per annum.</p>
<p class="cnomargins">Address, "Giglampz Publishing Co."</p>

<span class="caption">Reduced First Page of the First Issue.</span>
</div>

<p class="indent">With the issue of Number Seven (August 2, 1874) appeared
a notice that H. F. Farney and Company had
purchased the <i>Giglampz</i> from its former proprietors, the
new office being henceforth at the North-west corner of
Fourth and Race Streets. Number Eight was the last
furnished subscribers. Probably the only existing set of
this periodical is that kindly lent to me by Mr. Farney at
the request of Mr. Alexander Hill of The Robert Clarke
Company, Cincinnati. Among the many significant things
suggested in looking over the pages, is the fact that this
bound file was Hearn's personal copy, his name being
written on the cover-leaf by himself&mdash;"L. Hearn, 1877"&mdash;and
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;21]</span>
just below, this: "Reminiscences of An Editorship
under Difficulties."</p>

<p class="indent">It is noteworthy that nowhere is it publicly announced
that Hearn was the editor, although the fact was probably
an open secret in Cincinnati at the time. The truth of
the foregoing inscription in his handwriting is confirmed
by the acknowledgment of his authorship of most of the
articles, contributed as well as editorial, conveyed by his
customary signature, penciled at the end or beginning of
each paragraph or column which he had written. The
very title of the paper itself was a witness in the same
way, and shows that at that time, although Hearn kept
his name concealed, he was not, as later, sensitive concerning
his ocular defect.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> It is plain that the word <i>Giglampz</i>
refers to the large and conspicuous spectacles or eye-glasses
which at that time (not later) were worn habitually by
Hearn. The proof of this comes out in the illustration
occupying the full first page of the initial number, and
entitled:</p>

<p class="cnobmargin">"A Prospect of Herr Kladderadatsch,</p>
<p class="cnomargins">Introducynge</p>
<p class="cnotmargin">Mr. Giglampz tu ye Publycke."</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_6_6" id="Footnote_6_6"></a>
<a href="#FNanchor_6_6">
<span class="label">[6]</span></a> In the first number is an editorial paragraph, written by Hearn,
reading as follows:&mdash;"The public has indulged in speculation and
no little levity, in regard to our name. In this as in the future
conduct of this extraordinary sheet, we seek only to please ourselves.
Whether the Publishing Company will declare 'Irish Dividends' in
six months, or not, does not concern us. We (the editorial corps)
being on a salary, look on public favour with serene indifference.
The name pleases us. We look upon it in the light of a conundrum,
calculated to induce reflection in simple minds. We hope some one
may solve it, as we have incontinently given it up."</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">The scene is that of the stage of a theatre, and Kladderadatsch
proudly presents Mr. Giglampz to the wildly
applauding audience. The head of the obsequious Mr.
Giglampz is very large compared with his body, but most
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;22]</span>
conspicuous is the enormous <i>pince-nez</i> astride a nose of
fitting proportions. Mr. Farney was even permitted to
give a mere hint of the editor's facial expression.</p>

<p class="indent">A curious and suggestive, even a pathetic, light is thrown
upon Hearn's character by the fact that this personal file
of his journal with his own inscriptions, signatures, etc.,
was found in a second-hand book-store by Mr. Farney
after Hearn left Cincinnati.</p>

<p class="indent">Although it is as much too long for our quoting as it
was for introducing the journalistic venture, I cannot help
reproducing Hearn's first editorial, the "Salutatory, By a
Celebrated French Author, a Friend of Giglampz":</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">It was a dark and fearsome night in the month of June, 1874; and
the pavements of Fourth Street were abandoned to solitude.</p>

<p class="indent">The lamps, dripping huge water-drops fire-tinged from their lurid
glare, seemed monstrous yellow goblin-eyes, weeping phosphorescent
tears.</p>

<p class="indent">It was raining, and the funereal sky flamed with lightning. It was
such a rain as in the primeval world created verdant seas of slimy
mud, subsequently condensed into that fossiliferous strata where
to-day spectacled geologists find imbedded the awful remains of the
titanic <i>iguanodon</i>, the <i>plesiosaurus</i>, and the <i>icthyosaurus</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">We sat motionlessly meditative in the shadows of a Gothic doorway
of medieval pattern, and ruefully observed the movements of a
giant rat, slaking his thirst at a water-spout. Suddenly we were
aware of a pressure&mdash;a gentle pressure on our shoulder.</p>

<p class="indent">A hurried glance convinced us that the pressure was occasioned by
the presence of a hand.</p>

<p class="indent">It was a long, bony, ancient hand, dried and withered to the consistency
of India-rubber. It might have been compared to the hand
of a mummy embalmed in the reign of Rameses III, but we felt a
living warmth in its pressure, penetrating our summer linen.</p>

<p class="indent">The Oriental wizards occasionally need the assistance of a magic
candle, in their groping amid ancient tombs&mdash;a candle which burns
with a fuming stench so foul, that hungry ghouls flee dismayedly
away. This candle is made of green fat&mdash;the fat of men long dead.
For such a candle it is of course necessary to have a candlestick. To
procure this candlestick it is necessary to cut off the right hand of a
murderous criminal executed by impalement, and having carefully
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;23]</span>
dried it, to insert the candle in its ghastly grasp. Now the hand laid
on our shoulder strongly resembled such a hand.</p>

<p class="indent">The living warmth of its pressure alone restrained us from uttering
a shriek of hideous fear. A cold sweat ravaged the starched bosom
of our under-garment.</p>

<p class="indent">Suddenly a face peered out from the shadow, and the sickly glare
of the flickering gas-lamp fell full upon it.</p>

<p class="indent">The aspect of that face immediately reassured us.</p>

<p class="indent">It was long to grotesqueness and meagre even to weirdness. It
would have been strongly Mephistophelic but for an air of joviality
that was not wholly saturnine. The eyes were deep, piercing, but
"laughter-stirred," as those of Haroun Alraschid. The nose was
almost satanically aquiline, but its harsh outline was more than
relieved by the long smiling mouth, and the countless wrinkles of
merriment that intersected one another in crow's-feet all over the
ancient face. The stranger's complexion was that of caout-chouc;
and his long lank locks were blacker than the plumage of those
yellow-footed birds that prey upon the dead. His whole aspect was
that of one who, by some eerie, occult art of self-preservation, had
been enabled to live through the centuries.</p>

<p class="indent">"Am I not addressing the celebrated author&mdash;&mdash;?" said the voice
of the uncouthly-featured.</p>

<p class="indent">It was a half-merry, half-mocking voice&mdash;a deep voice that sounded
as though conveyed from a vast distance through the medium of a
pneumatic tube.</p>

<p class="indent">It therefore resembled in its tone the dreamily-distant voices never-slumbering
Fancy hears in the hours devoted to darkness and slumber
by moral people.</p>

<p class="indent">An enormous drop of soot-tinged water fell upon our nose, incontestably
proving that we were awake; and we murmured monosyllabic
assent to the stranger's query.</p>

<p class="indent">"It is well," replied the Unknown, with a latitudinarian smile of
joy. "I have been seeking you. I need your assistance, your talent,
your mental vigour so enormously manifested in your cyclopean<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>

morbid shyness about it of late years is noteworthy.</p>

<p class="indent">"<i>Sapristi</i>, monsieur!&mdash;permit me to inquire the nature of&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p class="indent">"Attend a little, friend, and your curiosity shall be sated with
ample satisfaction. I have existed as you see through all ages. I
have lived under a thousand alias names, under the various régimes
of a thousand civilizations, which flourished on ancient soil now
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;24]</span>
covered by the mile-deep waters of foaming oceans. I have made
my dwelling-place in the mighty palace-halls of Egyptian kings, in
the giant cities of dead Assyria, in the residences of Aztec monarchs
and Peruvian Incas, in the snow-columned temples of the Greek, and
the lordly homes of the luxurious Roman. In fact, I am rock-ribbed
and ancient as the sun; and have been worshipped as a genius in far-sparkling
planets ere this mundane sphere was first evolved from
that flaming orb. In all time when individualized intelligent thought
existed, I have inculcated in living beings the truth of that sublime
and eternal maxim&mdash;Laugh and grow fat. To-day men must be
taught this glorious truth by the Bullock Press rather than the Tongue.
I want your pen, not your tongue. Write me a salutatory for my new
illustrated weekly&mdash;only five cents a copy."</p>

<p class="indent">With these words he pressed a glazed Bristol-board card into our
trembling hand, and disappeared.</p>

<p class="indent">By the light of the weeping street-lamps we read thereon this weird
legend:</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="center">GIGLAMPZ</p>

<p class="indent">The title itself, the Introduction by "Kladderadatsch,"
and the character of the contributions and cuts make
it plain that the third object of the publication, called
"Satire," was designed to be much more prominent than
"Art" or "Literature." Unquestionably an American
<i>Kladderadatsch</i> was planned, and by Hearn and his friends
it was supposed that the editor had a sense of humour
sufficient to carry on the undertaking. I have quoted the
Salutatory to show that with the favouring of youth,
ambition, opportunity and the best encouragement, Hearn's
mind from the first line drifted inevitably to the fearsome,
the weird, the unearthly and far-away. By no power or
necessity could his imagination be forced or bound to the
task of producing things comic or even satiric, especially
such humour and jokes as the Cincinnati newspaper reader
wanted in 1874. Of the twelve columns of reading in the
first number of <i>Giglampz</i>, Hearn contributed about eight,
made up of fifteen or twenty distinct paragraphs. In the
second number his contributions number seven; in the
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;25]</span>
third, six; in the fourth, three; in the fifth, four; in the
sixth, two; in the seventh, one; in the eighth, one. In
about a dozen of the first number, he somewhat unsuccessfully
tried to be humorous or satiric, while six were
frankly tragical, critical, bitter, etc. In the succeeding
numbers Hearn made little effort to be humorous; in the
fifth number he describes with startling power a picture of
"a hideous scene in the interior of a seraglio;" in number
six he returns to the Orient and in "The Fantasy of a
Fan" mixes poetry, prose and fancy with a hinting of the
subtle soft witchery of the Hearn of twenty-five years
later.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> In the second number is a full-page cut, in which
Beecher is depicted as standing before a crowd of jeerers
prior to being placed in the stocks, with the scarlet letter
"A" upon his breast. Hearn especially requested Mr.
Farney to make him one of the conspicuous spectators.
The bespectacled face is easily recognizable in the copy
given me by the artist. In the seventh number Hearn
describes in two columns the story he supposes behind the
pictured Gabriel Max, called "The Last Farewell" (now
in the Metropolitan Museum, New York). It shows so
early suggestions of the manhood strength of the wordmaster
that I copy it:</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_8_8" id="Footnote_8_8"></a>
<a href="#FNanchor_8_8">
<span class="label">[8]</span></a> Mr. Farney tells me that he had to compel Hearn, even then, to
moderate the boldness of sentences which would by their sensualism
and licence shock their Cincinnati readers.</p>
</div>
</div>

<blockquote>
<p class="center">THE TALE A PICTURE TELLS</p>

<p class="center">"<i>Butchered to make a Roman Holiday</i>"</p>

<p class="indent">The remarkably fine engraving from Gabriel Max's picture, "The
Last Farewell," in a late issue of the Berlin <i>Illustrirte Zeitung</i> (and
which the New York <i>Graphic</i> a few days since stole to spoil in the
stealing), is worthy of the celebrated original at Munich&mdash;a painting
which will never be forgotten by those who have once beheld it.
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;26]</span>
Among modern painters, probably Max has no superior in the art of
harmoniously blending the horrible with the pathetic; and in none of
his works is this peculiar power exhibited to better advantage than in
"The Last Farewell:" a marvel of colour and composition, one of
those rare pictures which seem to reflect the living shadows of a dead
age with the weird truthfulness of a wizard's mirror.</p>

<p class="indent">A beautiful Roman girl is exposed in the Flavian amphitheatre, to
be devoured by wild beasts. She can scarcely be eighteen years old,
judging from the slender delicacy of her limbs and the childish sweetness
of the pretty little brown face which she has vainly been striving
to screen from the rude gaze of the shameless populace with the remnants
of a rich black veil&mdash;probably torn by the rough hands of some
brutal lanista. She leans with her back to the great wall of stone,
calmly awaiting her fate without any signs of fear, although the hot,
foul breath of a panther is already warm upon her naked feet. To her
right, but a few feet away, a leopard and a huge bear are tearing each
other to pieces; on her left, another den has just been thrown open,
and at its entrance appears the hideous head of an immense tiger,
with eyes that flame like emeralds.</p>

<p class="indent">You can almost feel the warmth of the fierce summer sun shining
on that scene of blood and crime, falling on the yellow sands of the
arena, drying the dark pools of human blood the wild beasts have left
unlapped. You can almost hear the deep hum of a hundred thousand
voices above, and the hideous growlings of the contending brutes
below. You wonder whether there is one heart in all that vast crowd
of cruel spectators wherein some faint impulse of humanity still lingers,
one tongue charitable enough to exclaim:</p>

<p class="indent">"Poor little thing!"</p>

<p class="indent">No: only wicked whispers followed by coarse laughter; monstrous
indifference in the lower tiers, brutal yells of bloodthirsty impatience
from the upper seats.</p>

<p class="indent">Two Roman knights relieve the monotony of the scene by strange
speculation.</p>

<p class="indent">"One hundred sesterces that the tiger gets her first!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Two hundred on the panther!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Done, by the gods! Where are the lions?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Why, that cursed barbarian killed the last three this morning, one
after another. The finest lions of the lot, too."</p>

<p class="indent">"Who are you talking about?&mdash;that tall, dark Thracian?"</p>

<p class="indent">"No: he was killed the day before by the same gladiator that
killed the lions. I mean that golden-haired giant&mdash;that Goth. Says
he was chief in his own country, or something. He's killed everybody
and everything pitted against him so far. And this morning they put
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;27]</span>
him naked in the arena, with nothing but a mirmillo's shield, and a
sword; and let the lions loose on him one after another. I bet a
thousand sesterces on that little Numidian lion; but the rascal killed
him as he sprang, with one sword-thrust, and I lost my thousand
sesterces. By Hercules, that Goth is a match for a dozen lions!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Brave fellow, by all the gods! Did they give him the wooden
sword?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Julius Cortonus says they did. I didn't stay to see the rest of the
games, for I was too angry about my thousand sesterces."</p>

<p class="indent">"Furies take that tiger!&mdash;I believe the brute's afraid of the girl!"</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">"Why, it is madness to throw such a fine-limbed girl as that to the
lions!" cries a Greek merchant, lately arrived in Rome. "Eyes and
hair, by Zeus, like Venus Anadyomene. I could sell her for a fortune
in a slave-market."</p>

<p class="indent">"Aedepol! not in a Roman slave-market, you fool. Why, I've
known Lucullus to throw better-looking girls than that into his fishpond,
to fatten his lampreys with. May Cerberus swallow that cursed
tiger!"</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">The tiger has not yet moved; his vast head and flaming green eyes
are just visible at the door of the den. The leopard and the bear are
still tearing one another. The panther is gradually, stealthily, noiselessly
approaching the poor, helpless girl.</p>

<p class="indent">Suddenly a fresh, bright-red rose is thrown from the seats above:
it is the last earthly greeting, the last farewell token of some old friend&mdash;perhaps
a brother, perhaps (O God!) a lover! It falls on the
blood-stained sand, shattering itself in perfumed ruin at the maiden's
feet.</p>

<p class="indent">She starts as the red leaves scatter before her. She advances from
the wall, and boldly withdrawing the fragments of her poor, torn veil,
looks up into the mighty sea of pitiless visages&mdash;looks up with her
sweet, childish, cherry-lipped face, and those great, dark, softly sad
Roman eyes&mdash;to thank him by a last look of love. "Who can it be?"</p>

<p class="indent">No one the maiden knows. She only sees a seemingly endless row
of cruel and sensual faces, the faces of the wild beast populace of
Rome,&mdash;the faces which smile at the sight of a living human body,
torn limb from limb by lions, and scattered over the sands in crimson
shreds of flesh....</p>

<p class="indent">Suddenly a terrible yet friendly eye meets and rivets the gaze of her
own&mdash;an eye keen and coldly-blue as a blade of steel. A sternly
handsome Northern face it is, with flowing yellow hair. For an instant
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;28]</span>
the iron lips seem to soften in a smile of pity, and the keen blue eyes
become brighter. So do the soft dark ones they meet in that piteous
farewell.</p>

<p class="indent">She has found her unknown friend.</p>

<p class="indent">... A crash&mdash;a fierce growl&mdash;a faint, helpless cry&mdash;a spray of
warm, bright blood.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">"Ah, Caius! you've lost your hundred sesterces. The Fates are
against you to-day!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Curse the Fates! Did you see the fool who threw her the
rose?"</p>

<p class="indent">"That great tall Titan of a fellow, with the yellow hair?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes. That's the Goth."</p>

<p class="indent">"What! the gladiator who killed the lions?"</p>

<p class="indent">"The same who won his freedom this morning. See! the fool's
wiping his eyes now. These Goths can fight like Hercules, but they
whine like sick women when a girl is hurt. They think up in the
North that women are to be worshipped like the immortal gods. I
wish they'd make the great red-headed brute go down and kill that
cursed tiger!"</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">Hearn's single contribution to the last number of the
fated <i>Giglampz</i> was a four-column retelling of "the weird
story of Loki's evil children from the strange folk-lore of
Ancient Scandinavia."</p>

<p class="indent">It was thus blood, sensualism and fiendishness that still
aroused Hearn's interest when not only not compelled to
the choice, but when they were contraindicated and wholly
illogical. But it was all a little less revolting, less real,
more artistic, than the tan-yard reporting, and it was
drawn from more remote sources. Mr. Henderson suggests
the same when he writes:</p>

<p class="indent">"But it was not in this slavery for a living even to crush
out of him the determination to advance and excel. In
the small hours of morning, into broad daylight, after the
rough work of the police rounds and the writing of perhaps
columns, in his inimitable style, he could be seen, under
merely a poor jet of gas, with his one useful eye close to
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;29]</span>
book and manuscript, translating 'One of Cleopatra's
Nights.' ...</p>

<p class="indent">"An Oriental warmth and glow pervaded him. While
his lines were hard ones in the grime and soot and trying
weather of Cincinnati, from which his frail body shrank
continually, his trend of thought was largely tropical.
Perhaps he saw beyond the dusky faces, rolling eyes and
broad noses of the people of the Cincinnati levee, the
mixed people of the West Indies and the beautiful little
ones of Japan, with whom he was destined to live before
long. However that may be, his greatest pleasure, after a
translation from Gautier or an original tragedy where he
could in his masterful way use his vocabulary of the gruesome,
was to study and absorb the indolent, sensuous life
of the negro race, as he found it in Cincinnati and New
Orleans, and to steep them in a sense of romance that he
alone could extract from the study. Things that were
common to these people in their everyday life, his vivid
imagination transformed into a subtle melody of romance.
The distant booming upon the midnight air of a river
steamer's whistle was for him the roustabout's call to his
waiting mistress at the landing, and his fruitful pen drew
the picture of their watching and coming and meeting."</p>

<p class="indent">The words <i>indolent and sensuous life</i> are also significant.
The tropics, their fatalism and the kind of life there lived
were drawing him with secret but irresistible force. Now
begins to mix with and mollify the gruesome a softer
element, also Oriental, or what is much the same thing,
tropical&mdash;sympathy with and study of the simple and
unlettered, those who are the improvident slaves of fate,
thoughtless impulse or heedless desire. To them, as we
shall see, Hearn's mind turned more and more. His was
essentially an Oriental mind and heart, an exotic weed
(and weeds may become the loveliest of flowers) dropped
by some migrating bird upon the strange crabbed soil of
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;30]</span>
the crudest of Occidentalism. Never did Hearn stop
yearning for the warmth, the fatalism and the laziness of
tropic semi-barbarism. The gruesome was not being
killed, but was being modified and tamed by civilization.</p>

<p class="indent">Hearn had been discharged from the <i>Commercial</i>, where
his salary was $25 a week, "on an ethical point of policy
which need not be discussed here. The <i>Commercial</i> took
him on at $22." Judge M. F. Wilson, of Cincinnati, tells
me that his discharge was caused by his seeking a licence
for and an open marriage with a coloured woman. The
licence was refused, because illegal at that time. The law
was repealed a little later. The marriage did not take
place.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_9_9" id="Footnote_9_9"></a>
<a href="#FNanchor_9_9">
<span class="label">[9]</span></a> Mr. George Mortimer Roe, at that time a friend of Hearn, now
living at Long Beach, California, writes me: "Hearn was quite
persistent in his efforts to persuade me to assist him in getting the
licence, but I told him I could not aid him in his ambition to be guilty
of miscegenation. For many years we had been the best of friends,
but from that time on he always avoided me, scarcely speaking to me
if by accident we did meet."</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">Mr. Henderson continues thus:</p>

<p class="indent">"As Hearn advanced in his power to write, the sense of
the discomforts of his situation in Cincinnati grew upon
him. His body and mind longed for the congeniality of
southern air and scenes. One morning, after the usual
hard work of an unusually nasty winter night in Cincinnati,
in a leisure hour of conversation, he heard an associate on
the paper describe a scene in a Gulf State. It was something
about a grand old mansion of an antebellum cotton
prince, with its great white columns, its beautiful private
drive down to the public road, whitewashed negro-quarters
stretching away in the background, in the distance some
cypress and live-oaks and Spanish moss, and close by a
grove of magnolias with their delightful odours and the
melody of mocking-birds in the early sunlight. Hearn
took in every word of this, though he had little to say at
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;31]</span>
the time, with great keenness of interest, as shown by the
dilation of his nostrils. It was as though he could see and
hear and smell the delights of the scene. Not long after
this, on leaving Cincinnati for New Orleans, he remarked:
'I have lost my loyalty to this paper, and change was
inevitable. Perhaps it isn't so much the lack of opportunity
here or a lack of appreciation of associations as this
beastly climate. I seem to shrivel up in this alternation of
dampness, heat and cold. I had to go sooner or later, but
it was your description of the sunlight and melodies and
fragrance and all the delights with which the South appeals
to the senses that determined me. I shall feel better in the
South and I believe I shall do better.'"</p>

<p class="indent">Some of his Cincinnati acquaintances speak of his
obsequious, even fawning, manner ("timid and feline of
approach," says Henderson), of his "washing his hands
with invisible water"&mdash;characteristics not dictated by the
parentage ascribed to him, not consonant with his photographs,
and not wholly with his gruesome traits. He wore
heavy myopic spectacles at this time, not to see (because
they were wholly discarded later), but probably in order
not to be seen&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> to hide the double deformity of his
eyes. One must remember that with or without spectacles
the world a foot or two away was much of a mystery to
Hearn, and that one fears a surely existent and near-by
mystery. One approaches it or comes within its power
with doubt, dislike and caution. The play of facial expression
was not to be seen by Hearn. All Uriah Heeps
may not be myopic, but all highly myopic persons will
have slow, stealthy, careful, even catlike attitudes and
manners; every step they take must be done with hesitation,
bowed head and great care, in order not to fall or
stumble against something. The wholly blind walk with
more decision and quickness. Of course this slow, soft
carefulness of manner, "the velvet feline step," was Hearn's
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;32]</span>
all his life. It followed inexorably that, though possessed
of a healthy and athletic body, there was possible for him
no athletics which required accuracy of sight or sequent
precision and celerity of movement. That with good eyes
he would have been an utterly different man in character
and in literature, is as certain as that he would have had a
very different manner, movement and style of physical
existence. With good eyes he would have been strong,
athletic, bold, as is admirably illustrated by the fact that
in the single sport in which little vision was required&mdash;swimming&mdash;he
was most expert, and that he enjoyed this
exercise to the fullest degree.</p>

<p class="indent">To scale a steeple in order to describe the city from
that unusual point of view was a task worthy of yellow
journalism which cared little for accuracy but much for
"scare" headlines. Hearn saw little or nothing of the
city, of course.</p>

<p class="indent">The only letters written during the Cincinnati period,
known to exist, are those of 1876, called, "Letters to a
Lady," published in the volume, <i>Letters from the Raven</i>,
Milton Bronner, editor.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> One other work, the origins of
which date from this period, is "One of Cleopatra's
Nights," and with this is demonstrated the beginning of
the influence of the modern French school of story-writers.
Hearn was tiring of the worst brutality and coarseness of
Occidentalism, and seeking a way to the true home of his
mind. The ghastly must become the ghostly. The
Frenchman's art was to become his half-way house.</p>

<hr class="hr2"/>

<p class="cap"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;34]</span>
I HAVE somewhere read of a nomad child of the desert,
born and rocked upon a camel, who was ever thereafter
incapable of resting more than a day in one place. Whether
or not the wandering father gave the homeless son his
illogical spirit of unrest, matters less than that Hearn had it
to a morbid degree. Any place rather than Cincinnati
would have been better for the happiness and success of the
emigrating boy, but his relatives had ridded themselves of
the burden by assenting to his wish. Excepting that to
Japan, the only sensible move he made was from Cincinnati
toward the tropics, to the half-way house thither&mdash;New
Orleans. The desire to seek the <i>au delà</i> was present, his
friends tell me, throughout the stay in Cincinnati. Perhaps
the single city in the world which would satisfy his dream
more nearly than could any other, was New Orleans.
Being psychologically for the most part of degenerate
Latin stock, and especially of the French variety, with the
requisite admixture of exotic and tropical barbarism;
bathed, but not cooked, in the hot and brilliant sunshine he
loved and hated; touched and energized by too little
Teutonic blood and influence, New Orleans offered to the
unhappy man the best possible surroundings for the growth
of his talents. Adding to this fortunate concensus of circumstance
and partly a corollary of it was the most fortunate
of all accidents that could have occurred to him&mdash;that is,
the existence of a daily newspaper such as the <i>Times-Democrat</i>;
of a paying mass of subscribers relishing
Hearn's translations from the most artistic French writers
of the short-story; and, most important of all, the presence
on the bridge of the noble Captain of the Newspaper enterprise,
the veteran editor, Mr. Page M. Baker. One shudders
to think what would have been Hearn's later career had it
not been for the guidance and help of this wise, sympathetic
and magnanimous friend. For the one thing needed by
Hearn in those who would be his friends rather than their
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;35]</span>
own was magnanimity. It was his frequent misfortune in
life to come under the influence of those as incapable of
true unselfishness and real kindness as it was natural for
them to be cunning and to use an assumed friendship for
hidden flatteries and purposes of their own. Most of these
would not have dreamed of associating with the man for
any reason other than to stand in the reflected light
of his literary fame. Most of them had as little care for his
poetic prose, and as little appreciation or knowledge of
good literature as they had of "the enclitic <i>de</i>." They had
no magnanimity, only wile instead of it. As Hearn was
also deprived of large-mindedness in all affairs of the
world, he was unhappily prone to accept the offered bribe.
He wanted above all things to be flattered and to do as his
imperious impulses and weak will suggested. Any one
who recognized these things in him and seconded the follies,
remained his permitted "friend," but those who withstood
them in the least and ran counter to his morbid trends and
resolves&mdash;these were speedily "dropped," and insulted or
grieved to silence. If they had magnanimity, they bore
with the man in pity and answered his insults with kind
words and kinder deeds. They recognized that they were
responsible not to the man but to the carrier of a great
talent, and although they might not forget, they gladly
forgave, if possibly they might speed him on his predestined
way.</p>

<p class="indent">Of this number was Baker. Directly or indirectly through
him, came a long and happy period of life; came the congenial,
educating work, without slavery, of the translations
and other easy reportorial services. Of equal importance
were the financial rewards. Before and after the New
Orleans time not the least of Hearn's misfortunes was his
intolerable and brutalizing improvidence and impecuniousness.
Under Baker's friendship he came to what for such a
person was affluence and independence. He found leisure
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;36]</span>
to read and study and think outside of the journalistic pale,
and better still, perhaps,&mdash;better to his thinking, at least&mdash;he
secured the means to indulge his life-long desire for
curious and out-of-the-way books. During this time it
grew to consciousness with him that in everything, except
as regards his beloved Art, he had a little learned to
recognize the worth of money.</p>

<p class="indent">But within him grew ever stronger the plague of the
unsatisfied, the sting of unrest, and he was compelled to
obey. In a letter to me from Martinique, after he had
recognized his mistake, he admits and explains as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">I seldom have a chance now to read or speak English; and English
phrases that used to seem absolutely natural already begin to look
somewhat odd to me. Were I to continue to live here for some years
more, I am almost sure that I should find it difficult to write English.
The resources of the intellectual life are all lacking here,&mdash;no libraries,
no books in any language;&mdash;a mind accustomed to discipline becomes
like a garden long uncultivated, in which the rare flowers return to
their primitive savage forms, or are smothered by rank, tough growths
which ought to be pulled up and thrown away. Nature does not allow
you to think here, or to study seriously, or to work earnestly: revolt
against her, and with one subtle touch of fever she leaves you helpless
and thoughtless for months.</p>

<p class="indent">But she is so beautiful, nevertheless, that you love her more and
more daily,&mdash;that you gradually cease to wish to do aught contrary
to her local laws and customs. Slowly, you begin to lose all affection
for the great Northern nurse that taught you to think, to work, to
aspire. Then, after a while, this nude, warm, savage, amorous Southern
Nature succeeds in persuading you that labour and effort and purpose
are foolish things,&mdash;that life is very sweet without them;&mdash;and
you actually find yourself ready to confess that the aspirations and
inspirations born of the struggle for life in the North are all madness,&mdash;that
they wasted years which might have been delightfully dozed away
in a land where the air is always warm, the sea always the colour
of sapphire, the woods perpetually green as the plumage of a green
parrot.</p>

<p class="indent">I must confess I have had some such experiences. It appears to
me impossible to resign myself to living again in a great city and
in a cold climate. Of course I shall have to return to the States for
a while,&mdash;a short while, probably;&mdash;but I do not think I will ever
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;37]</span>
settle there. I am apt to become tired of places,&mdash;or at least of the
disagreeable facts attaching more or less to all places and becoming
more and more marked and unendurable the longer one stays. So
that ultimately I am sure to wander off somewhere else. You can
comprehend how one becomes tired of the very stones of a place,&mdash;the
odours, the colours, the shapes of Shadows, and the tint of its sky;&mdash;and
how small irritations become colossal and crushing by years of
repetition;&mdash;yet perhaps you will not comprehend that one can
become weary of a whole system of life, of civilization, even with
very limited experience. Such is exactly my present feeling,&mdash;an
unutterable weariness of the aggressive characteristics of existence
in a highly organized society. The higher the social development,
the sharper the struggle. One feels this especially in America,&mdash;in
the nervous centres of the world's activity. One feels it least, I
imagine, in the tropics, where it is such an effort just to live, that
one has no force left for the effort to expand one's own individuality
at the cost of another's. I clearly perceive that a man enamoured
of the tropics has but two things to do:&mdash;To abandon intellectual
work, or to conquer the fascination of Nature. Which I will do will
depend upon necessity. I would remain in this zone if I could maintain
a certain position here;&mdash;to keep it requires means. I can earn
only by writing, and yet if I remain a few years more, I will have
become (perhaps?) unable to write. So if I am to live in the
tropics, as I would like to do, I must earn the means for it in very
short order.</p>

<p class="indent">I gave up journalism altogether after leaving N. O. I went to
Demerara and visited the lesser West Indies in July and August
of last year,&mdash;returned to New York after three months with some
MS.,&mdash;sold it,&mdash;felt very unhappy at the idea of staying in New York,
where I had good offers,&mdash;suddenly made up my mind to go back
to the tropics by the same steamer that had brought me. I had
no commission, resolved to trust to magazine-work. So far I have
just been able to scrape along;&mdash;the climate numbs mental life,
and the inspirations I hoped for won't come. The real&mdash;surpassing
imagination&mdash;whelms the ideal out of sight and hearing. The world
is young here,&mdash;not old and wise and grey as in the North; and one
must not seek the Holy Ghost in it. I suspect that the material
furnished by the tropics can only be utilized in a Northern atmosphere.
We will talk about it together.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">That he never thought to return to New Orleans is
demonstrated by the fact that when he left, he shipped
his books to another good friend and great editor, Mr.
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;38]</span>
Alden, to keep for him. When he came to the United
States in 1889, he fully intended returning to some
tropical land. But it was otherwise ordered, and most
fortunately, for a year or two more of life under such
conditions would have killed both mind and body.</p>

<p class="indent">Upon Hearn's arrival in New Orleans, he began sending
a series of charming letters to the Cincinnati <i>Commercial</i>,
signed "Ozias Midwinter."<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> They are, indeed, exquisite,
and as certainly of a delicacy and beauty which must have
made the reader of that time and newspaper wonder what
strange sort of a correspondent the editor had secured.
The first letter was about Memphis, passed on his way
South. I cite some parts to show how the gruesome
was merging into or being supplanted by something
larger and better, and also to illustrate Hearn's growing
interest in colours.</p>

a friend and lent to me.</p>
</div>
</div>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">The stranger, however, is apt to leave Memphis with one charming
recollection of the place&mdash;the remembrance of the sunset scene from
the bluffs across the river over Arkansas. I do not think that any part
of the world can offer a more unspeakably beautiful spectacle to the
traveller than what he may witness any fair evening from those rugged
old bluffs at Memphis. The first time I saw it the day had been perfectly
bright and clear,&mdash;the blue of the sky was unclouded by the least
fleecy stain of white cloud; and the sun descended in the west,&mdash;not
in a yellow haze, or a crimson fog, but with the splendour of his fiery
glory almost undimmed. He seemed to leave no trace of his bright
fires behind him; and the sky-blue began to darken into night-purple
from the east almost immediately. I thought at first it was one of the
least romantic sunsets I had ever seen. It was not until the stars
were out, and the night had actually fallen, that I beheld the imperial
magnificence of that sunset.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">I once thought, when sailing up the Ohio one bright Northern
summer, that the world held nothing more beautiful than the scenery
of the Beautiful River&mdash;those voluptuous hills with their sweet
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;39]</span>
feminine curves, the elfin gold of that summer haze, and the pale
emerald of the river's verdure-reflecting breast. But even the
loveliness of the Ohio seemed faded, and the Northern sky-blue
palely cold, like the tint of iceberg pinnacles, when I beheld for the
first time the splendour of the Mississippi.</p>

<p class="indent">"You must come on deck early to-morrow," said the kind Captain
of the <i>Thompson Dean</i>; "we are entering the Sugar Country."</p>

<p class="indent">So I saw the sun rise over the cane-fields of Louisiana.</p>

<p class="indent">It rose with a splendour that recalled the manner of its setting at
Memphis, but of another colour;&mdash;an auroral flush of pale gold and
pale green bloomed over the long fringe of cottonwood and cypress
trees, and broadened and lengthened half-way round the brightening
world. The glow seemed tropical, with the deep green of the trees
sharply cutting against it; and one naturally looked for the feathery
crests of cocoanut palms. Then the day broke gently and slowly&mdash;a
day too vast for a rapid dawn&mdash;a day that seemed deep as Space.
I thought our Northern sky narrow and cramped as a vaulted church-roof
beside that sky&mdash;a sky so softly beautiful, so purely clear in its
immensity, that it made one dream of the tenderness of a woman's
eyes made infinite.</p>

<p class="indent">And the giant river broadened to a mile&mdash;smooth as a mirror, still
and profound as a mountain lake. Between the vastness of the sky
and the vastness of the stream, we seemed moving suspended in the
midst of day, with only a long, narrow tongue of land on either side
breaking the brightness. Yet the horizon never became wholly
blue. The green-golden glow lived there all through the day; it was
brightest in the south. It was so tropical, that glow;&mdash;it seemed
of the Pacific, a glow that forms a background to the sight of lagoons
and coral reefs and "lands where it is always afternoon."</p>

<p class="indent">Below this glow gleamed another golden green, the glory of the
waving cane-fields beyond the trees. Huge sugar-mills were breathing
white and black clouds into the sky, as they masticated their mighty
meal; and the smell of saccharine sweetness floated to us from either
shore. Then we glided by miles of cotton-fields with their fluttering
white bolls; and by the mouths of broad bayous;&mdash;past swamps dark
with cypress gloom, where the grey alligator dwells, and the grey
Spanish moss hangs in elfish festoons from ancient trees;&mdash;past
orange-trees and live-oaks, pecans and cottonwoods and broad-leaved
bananas; while the green of the landscape ever varied, from a green
so dark that it seemed tinged with blue to an emerald so bright that
it seemed shot through with gold. The magnificent old mansions of
the Southern planters, built after a generous fashion unknown in the
North, with broad verandas and deliciously cool porches, and all
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;40]</span>
painted white or perhaps a pale yellow, looked out grandly across the
water from the hearts of shadowy groves; and, like villages of a
hundred cottages, the negro quarters dotted the verdant face of the
plantation with far-gleaming points of snowy whiteness.</p>

<p class="indent">And still that wondrous glow brightened in the south, like a far-off
reflection of sunlight on the Spanish Main.</p>

<p class="indent">"But it does not look now as it used to in the old slave days," said
the pilot, as he turned the great wheel. "The swamps were drained,
and the plantations were not overgrown with cottonwood; and somehow
or other the banks usen't to cave in then as they do now."</p>

<p class="indent">I saw indeed signs of sad ruin on the face of the great plantations;
there were splendid houses crumbling to decay, and whole towns of
tenantless cabins; estates of immense extent were lying almost
unfilled, or with only a few acres under cultivation; and the vigorous
cottonwood trees had shot up in whole forests over fields once made
fertile by the labour of ten thousand slaves. The scene was not
without its melancholy; it seemed tinged by the reflection of a glory
passed away&mdash;the glory of wealth, and the magnificence of wealth; of
riches and the luxury of riches.</p>

<p class="indent">O fair paradise of the South, if still so lovely in thy ruin, what must
thou have been in the great day of thy greatest glory!</p>

<p class="indent">White steamboats, heavily panting under their loads of cotton,
came toiling by, and called out to us wild greeting long and shrill,
until the pilot opened the lips of our giant boat, and her mighty
challenge awoke a thousand phantom voices along the winding shore.
Red sank the sun in a sea of fire, and bronze-hued clouds piled up
against the light, like fairy islands in a sea of glory, such as were
seen, perhaps, by the Adelantado of the Seven Cities.</p>

<p class="indent">"Those are not real clouds," said the pilot, turning to the west, his
face aglow with the yellow light. "Those are only smoke clouds
rising from the sugar mills of Louisiana, and drifting with the
evening wind."</p>

<p class="indent">The daylight died away and the stars came out, but that warm glow
in the southern horizon only paled, so that it seemed a little further
off. The river broadened till it looked with the tropical verdure of its
banks like the Ganges, until at last there loomed up a vast line of
shadows, dotted with points of light, and through a forest of masts
and a host of phantom-white river boats and a wilderness of chimneys
the <i>Thompson Dean</i>, singing her cheery challenge, steamed up to the
mighty levee of New Orleans.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">The letters descriptive of New Orleans scenes and life
deserve republishing had I space for them here. In a brief
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;41]</span>
paragraph, a sentence perhaps, almost in a word, is given
the photograph, chromatic and vitalized in Hearn's unrivalled
picturesque style, of the levees, the shipping, the
sugar-landing, the cotton-shipping, the ocean steamers, the
strange mixture of peoples from all countries and climes;
the architecture, streets, markets, etc. The Vendetta of
the Sicilian immigrants is described with a strength
and vividness which bear eloquent witness to Hearn's
innate pleasure in such themes. There is also shown his
beginning the study of Creole character, grammar, and
language. A peculiarly striking picture is painted of the
new huge cotton-press, as a monster whose jaws open with
a low roar to devour the immense bale of cotton and to
crush it to a few inches of thickness. I cannot exclude
this excerpt:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">Do you remember that charming little story, "Père Antoine's Date-Palm,"
written by Thomas Bailey Aldrich, and published in the same
volume with "Marjorie Daw" and other tales?</p>

<p class="indent">Père Antoine was a good old French priest, who lived and died in
New Orleans. As a boy, he conceived a strong friendship for a fellow
student of about his own age, who, in after years, sailed to some
tropical island in the Southern Seas, and wedded some darkly beautiful
woman, graceful and shapely and tall as a feathery palm. Père
Antoine wrote often to his friend, and their friendship strengthened
with the years, until death dissolved it. The young colonist died, and
his beautiful wife also passed from the world; but they left a little
daughter for some one to take care of.</p>

<p class="indent">The good priest, of course, took care of her, and brought her up at
New Orleans. And she grew up graceful and comely as her mother,
with all the wild beauty of the South. But the child could not forget
the glory of the tropics, the bright lagoon, the white-crested sea roaring
over the coral reef, the royal green of the waving palms, and the beauty
of the golden-feathered birds that chattered among them.</p>

<p class="indent">So she pined for the tall palms and the bright sea and the wild reef,
until there came upon her that strange homesickness which is death;
and still dreaming of the beautiful palms, she gradually passed into
that great sleep which is dreamless. And she was buried by Père
Antoine near his own home.</p>

<p class="indent">By and by, above the little mound there suddenly came a gleam of
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;42]</span>
green; and mysteriously, slowly, beautifully, there grew up towering
in tropical grace above the grave, a princely palm. And the old priest
knew that it had grown from the heart of the dead child.</p>

<p class="indent">So the years passed by, and the roaring city grew up about the
priest's home and the palm-tree, trying to push Père Antoine off his
land. But he would not be moved. They piled up gold upon his
doorsteps and he laughed at them; they went to law with him and he
beat them all; and, at last, dying, he passed away true to his trust;
for the man who cuts down that palm-tree loses the land that it grows
upon.</p>

<p class="indent">"And there it stands," says the Poet, "in the narrow, dingy street,
a beautiful dreamy stranger, an exquisite foreign lady, whose grace is
a joy to the eye, the incense of whose breath makes the air enamoured.
May the hand wither that touches her ungently!"</p>

<p class="indent">Now I was desirous above all things to visit the palm made famous
by this charming legend, and I spent several days in seeking it. I
visited the neighbourhood of the old Place d'Armes&mdash;now Jackson
Square&mdash;and could find no trace of it; then I visited the southern
quarter of the city, with its numberless gardens, and I sought for the
palm among groves of orange-trees overloaded with their golden fruit,
amid broad-leaved bananas, and dark cypresses, and fragrant magnolias
and tropical trees of which I did not know the names. Then I
found many date-palms. Some were quite young, with their splendid
crest of leafy plumes scarcely two feet above the ground; others stood
up to a height of thirty or forty feet. Whenever I saw a tall palm, I
rang the doorbell and asked if that were Père Antoine's date-palm.
Alas! nobody had ever heard of the Père Antoine.</p>

<p class="indent">Then I visited the ancient cathedral, founded by the pious Don
Andre Almonaster, Regidor of New Orleans, one hundred and fifty
years ago; and I asked the old French priest whether they had ever
heard of the Père Antoine. And they answered me that they knew
him not, after having searched the ancient archives of the ancient
Spanish Cathedral.</p>

<p class="indent">Once I found a magnificent palm, loaded with dates, in a garden on
St. Charles Street, so graceful that I felt the full beauty of Solomon's
simile as I had never felt it before: "Thy stature is like to a palm-tree."
I rang the bell and made inquiry concerning the age of the
tree. It was but twenty years old; and I went forth discouraged.</p>

<p class="indent">At last, to my exceeding joy, I found an informant in the person of
a good-natured old gentleman, who keeps a quaint bookstore in
Commercial Place. The tree was indeed growing, he said, in New
Orleans Street, near the French Cathedral, and not far from Congo
Square; but there were many legends concerning it. Some said it
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;43]</span>
had been planted over the grave of some Turk or Moor&mdash;perhaps a
fierce corsair from Algiers or Tunis&mdash;who died while sailing up the
Mississippi, and was buried on its moist shores. But it was not at all
like the other palm-trees in the city, nor did it seem to him to be a
date-palm. It was a real Oriental palm; yea, in sooth, such a palm as
Solomon spake of in his Love-song of Love-songs.</p>

<p class="indent">"I said, I will go up to the palm-tree; I will take hold of the boughs
thereof." ...</p>

<p class="indent">I found it standing in beautiful loneliness in the centre of a dingy
woodshed on the north side of New Orleans Street, towering about
forty feet above the rickety plank fence of the yard. The gateway
was open, and a sign swung above it bearing the name, "M. Michel."
I walked in and went up to the palm-tree. A labourer was sawing
wood in the back-shed, and I saw through the windows of the little
cottage by the gate a family at dinner. I knocked at the cottage-door,
and a beautiful Creole woman opened it.</p>

<p class="indent">"May I ask, Madame, whether this palm-tree was truly planted by
the Père Antoine?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Ah, Monsieur, there are many droll stories which they relate of that
tree. There are folks who say that a young girl was interred there, and
it is also said that a Sultan was buried under that tree&mdash;or the son of a
Sultan. And there are also some who say that a priest planted it."</p>

<p class="indent">"Was it the Père Antoine, Madame?"</p>

<p class="indent">"I do not know, Monsieur. There are people also who say that it
was planted here by Indians from Florida. But I do not know whether
such trees grow in Florida. I have never seen any other palm-tree
like it. It is not a date-palm. It flowers every year, with a
beautiful yellow blossom the colour of straw, and the blossoms
hang down in pretty curves. Oh, it is very graceful! Sometimes
it bears fruit, a kind of oily fruit, but not dates. I am told that they
make oil from the fruit of such palms."</p>

<p class="indent">I thought it looked so sad, that beautiful tree in the dusty woodyard,
with no living green thing near it. As its bright verdant leaves waved
against the blue above, one could not but pity it as one would pity
some being, fair and feminine and friendless in a strange land. "<i>Oh,
c'est bien gracieux</i>," murmured the handsome Creole lady.</p>

<p class="indent">"Is it true, Madame, that the owner of the land loses it if he cuts
down the tree?"</p>

<p class="indent">"<i>Mais oui!</i> But the proprietors of the ground have always respected
the tree, because it is so old, so very old!"</p>

<p class="indent">Then I found the proprietor of the land, and he told me that when
the French troops first arrived in this part of the country they noticed
that tree. "Why," I exclaimed, "that must have been in the reign of
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;44]</span>
Louis XIV!" "It was in 1679, I believe," he answered. As for the
Père Antoine, he had never heard of him. Neither had he heard of
Thomas Bailey Aldrich. So that I departed, mourning for my dead
faith in a romance which was beautiful.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">Next to his best Japanese studies, I suspect it will finally
come to recognition that Hearn's greatest service to literature
is his magnificent series of translations during the
New Orleans years. As a translator there were given him
his data by creative minds. His own mental equipment
prevented creation, and his clearly set limits as a translator
added power to his ability and function as a colourist and
word-artist. His was almost a unique expertness of
entering into the spirit of his models, refeeling their
emotions, reimagining their thought and art, and reclothing
it with the often somewhat hard and stiff material of English
weaving. All of their spirit philologically possible to be
conveyed to us, we may be sure he re-presents. For his
was the rare power of the instant, the iridescent, the
wingèd word. I think it was innate and spontaneous with
him, a gift of the inscrutable, illogic, and fantastically
generous-niggard Fates. All his studies and conscious
efforts were almost unavailing either to hinder or to further
its perfection. If to Fate we may not be grateful, we can
at least thank the weird lesser gods of life for the
mysterious wonder of the gift. The wealth of loving labour
silently offered in the 187 or more translations published in
the <i>Times-Democrat</i> is marvellous. Hearn brought to my
house the loose cuttings from the files, and we got them
into some order in "scrapbooks." But the dates of publication
and other details are often characteristically wanting.
Elsewhere in the present volume the titles, etc., of the
stories are listed. Preceded by those of "One of Cleopatra's
Nights," they form a body of literary values which should
be rescued from the newspaper files and permanently
issued in book-form for the pleasure and instruction of
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;45]</span>
English readers. To do this I have most generously been
given permission by Hearn's ever helpful and discriminating
friend, Mr. Page M. Baker, editor of the <i>Times-Democrat</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">Hearn knew well the difficulties of the translator's art.
"One who translates for the love of the original will
probably have no reward save the satisfaction of creating
something beautiful and perhaps of saving a masterpiece
from less reverent hands." So anxious was he to do such work
that he was willing to pay the publication expenses. As
pertinent, I copy an editorial of his on the subject, which
was published in the <i>Times-Democrat</i>, during the period
in which he was so busy as a translator:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">The New York <i>Nation</i> has been publishing in its columns a number
of interesting and severe criticisms upon translations from foreign
authors. These translations are generally condemned, and with good
specifications of reasons,&mdash;notwithstanding the fact that some of them
have been executed by persons who have obtained quite a popular
reputation as translators. One critic dwells very strongly upon the
most remarkable weakness of all the renderings in question;&mdash;they
invariably fail to convey the colour and grace of the original, even
when the meaning is otherwise preserved. Speaking of the translators
themselves, the reviewer observes: "There is not one <i>artist</i> among
them."</p>

<p class="indent">All this is very true; but the writer does not explain the causes of
this state of affairs. They are many, no doubt;&mdash;the principal fact
for consideration being that there is no demand for artistic work in
translation. And there is no demand for it, not so much because it is
rare and unlikely to be appreciated as because it is dear. Artistic
translators cannot afford to work for a song,&mdash;neither would they
attempt to translate a five-hundred-page novel in three weeks or a
month as others do. Again, artistic translators would not care to
attach their names to the published translation of a fourth-or fifth-class
popular novel. Finally, artistic translations do not obtain a ready
market with first-class American publishers, who, indeed, seldom
touch domestic translations of foreign fiction, and depend for their
translations of European literature upon transatlantic enterprise.
Thus the artistic translator may be said to have no field. He may
sell his work to some petty publisher, perhaps, but only at a price that
were almost absurd to mention;&mdash;and the first-class publishers do not
care to speculate in American translations at all. We might also add
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;46]</span>
that the translator's task is always a thankless one,&mdash;that however
superb and laborious his execution, it can never obtain much public
notice, nor even so much as public comprehension. The original
author will be admired,&mdash;the translator unnoticed, except by a few
critics.</p>

<p class="indent">Moreover, the men capable of making the most artistic translations
are usually better employed. The translator of a great French, German,
or Italian masterpiece of style, ought, in the eternal fitness of
things, to be a man able to write something very artistic in his own
tongue. No one seems to doubt that Longfellow was the man to
translate Dante,&mdash;that Tennyson could parallel Homer (as he has
shown by a wonderful effort) in the nineteenth-century English,&mdash;that
Carlyle re-created Goethe's "Wilhelm Meister" by his rendering of it,&mdash;that
Austin Dobson was the first to teach English readers some of
the beauties of Gautier's poetry,&mdash;that Swinburne alone could have
made François Villon adopt an English garb which exactly fitted him.
But the same readers perhaps never gave a thought to the fact that
the works of Flaubert, of Daudet, of Droz, of Hugo, of at least a score
of other European writers, call for work of an almost equally high
class on the part of the translator, and never receive it! What a
translation of Daudet could not Henry James give us!&mdash;how admirably
John Addington Symonds could reproduce for us the Venetian richness
of Paul de Saint Victor's style! But such men are not likely to
be invited, on either side of the Atlantic, to do such work;&mdash;neither
are they likely to do it as a labour of love! A splended translation
of Flaubert might be expected from several members of what is called
"The New England School;" but what Boston publisher would
engage his favourite literary man in such pursuits? It is really
doubtful whether the men most capable of making artistic translations
could afford, under any ordinary circumstances, to undertake much
work of the kind, except as a literary recreation. At all events, the
English-reading world cannot hereafter expect to obtain its translations
from other European languages through the labour of the best writers
in its own. The only hope is, that the recklessness shown by publishers
in their choice of translators will provoke a reaction, and that such
work will be more generously remunerated and entrusted to real
experts hereafter.</p>

<p class="indent">It is unfortunately true that the translators who work for English
publishers are far more competent than those who do similar work in
the United States; forasmuch as transatlantic firms are glad to print
cheap popular translations, while only inferior American firms care to
undertake them. Another obstacle to good translations in the United
States is that none of the great literary periodicals will devote space
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;47]</span>
to them. The English and the French magazines and reviews are
less conservative, and some very wonderful translations have been
published by them. Artistic translation might be admirably developed
in this country by the establishment of a new magazine-policy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">The wise reader, if he is also a sincere friend of Hearn,
must wish that the correspondence published had been
limited to the first volume. Room aplenty in this could
have been made for the dozen valuable paragraphs contained
in the second. It is not strange that the letters of
Hearn worth saving were written before his departure for
Japan. He repeatedly had urged that letter-writing both
financially and mentally was expensive to the writer. In
Japan he was so incessantly busy, much with his teaching
and more with his real literary work, that time and will
were wanting for that sort of letters which are of interest
to the general reader. The interest of the person addressed
is another affair. The dreary half-thousand pages of the
correspondence of the Japanese time are most disappointing
to one who has been thrilled by almost every page of
the incomparable letters to Krehbiel and to a few others.
Besides the two reasons for this which I have suggested,
there are others which may perhaps be evident to some
judicious readers, but which at this time may scarcely be
plainly stated. At present the trees are so thick that the
forest cannot be seen, but some day an amused and an
amusing smile of recognition and disgust will curl the lips
of the literary critic. There are two other considerations
which should be held in mind: One of them was brought
to me by a correspondent of Hearn who had frequently
noted it; sometimes (has it happened before?) Hearn used
his "friend" to whom he was writing, as a sort of method
of exercising his own fancy, as a gymnastics in putting his
imagination through its paces, or for a preliminary sketching
in of notes and reminders to be of possible use in later
serious work. Moreover, the plan was of service in rewarding
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;48]</span>
his correspondents for their praise and appreciation.
Of a far more substantial character were the letters sometimes
written in gratitude for money received. Hearn
flattered himself, as we know, that he was without
"cunning," but there is at least one exquisitely ludicrous
letter in existence which shows an inverted proof of it, in
the execution of an Indian war-dance, because of "the
ways and means" furnished.</p>

<p class="indent">As published, Hearn's letters may be classified as
follows: To</p>

<p class="indent">Besides these, the valuable series of "Letters from a
Raven," and the sixteen in the same volume "To a Lady"
are noteworthy. The latter are of little value either for
biography or literature. But the letters to Watkin are so
sincere, often childlike, indeed, that they will be prized by
the discriminating. Another admirable series, copies of
which I have, is made up of letters to Professor R. Matas,
of New Orleans. To these it is hoped will sometime be
added those which must exist, to Mr. Alden, who was an
early and sincere friend. There are a number of unpublished
letters to Gould, and the published ones have
been so mutilated that they should be correctly republished.
Almost anything written by Hearn before he went to
Japan, or in some instances reflecting friendships and
feelings existing before he sailed, may prove of as inestimable
value as most letters written thereafter will
probably be found valueless.</p>

<p class="indent">It is noteworthy that the first series, edited by Miss
Bisland, was commenced in 1877, when Hearn was twenty-seven
years of age, and that for many years Mr. Krehbiel
was almost his sole correspondent. But the inimitable
perfection and preciousness of these fifty-six letters! They
are well worth all his other set productions, published or
burned, of the same years. Many are singly worth all the
rest of our letters. Here the dreamer&mdash;and a dreamer he
always was until he got out of his cocoon&mdash;was sincere,
hopeful, planful, as playful as his sombre mind would permit,
but always magnificently, even startlingly, unreserved.
Remembering that Hearn's mind was essentially an echoing
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;50]</span>
and a colouring mechanism, it is at once a glorious
tribute to, and a superlative merit of Mr. Krehbiel to have
given the primary and stimulating voice to the always
listening dreamer. To have swerved him out of his predestined
rôle so much as to make these pages so astonishingly
full of <i>musical</i> reverberations, is a tribute to his own
musical enthusiasm and power as it is also a demonstration
of the echo-like, but fundamentally unmusical, nature of
his friend's mind. If only in the final edition of Hearn's
works, these letters with selections of some pages from a few
others, could be made into a handy, small, and cheap volume
for the delighting of the appreciators of literature and of
literary character! Comparison of the spiritual and almost
<i>spirituelle</i> flashings of these, with the ponderous and banal
sogginess of hundreds upon hundreds of other pages of his
letters, arouses the profound regret that Hearn to the
world was "impossible," that, as he says, he "could not
mingle with men," that no other voices ever so intimately
reached the heart of him, or of his dreaming. Even here
the amazing coloration furnished by "The Dreamer," as he
calls himself, makes us at times feel that the magic of the
word-artist and colour-mixer was almost superior to the
enduring and awakening reality of Mr. Krehbiel. To this
friend, as he writes, he spoke of his thoughts and fancies,
wishes and disappointments, frailties, follies, and failures,
and successes&mdash;even as to a brother. And that was not all
he saw and heard in "his enchanted City of Dreams."</p>

<p class="indent">The slavery to ignoble journalism, what he calls a
"really nefarious profession," was to be resolutely renounced
from the day of his arrival in New Orleans. It is
"a horrid life," he "could not stand the gaslight;" he
"damned reportorial work and correspondence, and the
American disposition to work people to death, and the
American delight in getting worked to death;" he rebelled
against becoming a part of the revolving machinery of a
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;51]</span>
newspaper, because "journalism dwarfs, stifles, emasculates
thought and style," and he was bound to "produce something
better in point of literary execution."</p>

<p class="indent">There was also a not frankly confessed resolve to become
respectable in other ways, and to be done with a kind of
entanglement of which he was painfully conscious in the
Cincinnati life. "I think I can redeem myself socially
here! I have got into good society;" "it is better to live
here in sackcloth and ashes, than to own the whole State
of Ohio," he writes, and he is proud of living in a Latin
city. He recognizes what Mr. Krehbiel calls his "peculiar
and unfortunate disposition," and which he later sets forth
as "a very small, erratic, eccentric, irregular, impulsive,
variable, nervous disposition." Hearn visits a few friends
awhile and then disappears for six months, so that he
wishes to be hidden in New York except to Krehbiel and
Tunison; he will pay a visit to the others he must see just
before leaving town&mdash;for he is a "demophobe." He tried
a secret partnership in keeping a restaurant, and thought
to carry on a little French bookstore. He resolved at
different times to go to Europe, to Cuba, to Texas, to
Cincinnati, and planned all sorts of occupations.</p>

<p class="indent">The indications soon multiply that in more ways than in
worldly matters he is at variance with his world. He
"regards thought as a mechanical process;" he has "no
faith in any faith;" "individual life is a particle of that
eternal force of which we know so little;" "Soul = Cerebral
Activity = Soul;" Jesus is a legend and myth; he is
"not a believer in free will, nor in the individual soul," etc.
Think of a man writing to a Christian minister, think of a
Christian minister receiving without protest a personal
letter with this in it: "Nor can I feel more reverence for
the crucified deity than for that image of the Hindoo god
of light holding in one of his many hands Phallus, and yet
wearing a necklace of skulls, etc."</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;52]</span>
And Hearn, as to ethics, has the courage to write his
friend of his convictions: "Passion was the inspiring breath
of Greek art and the mother of language; its gratification
the act of a creator, and the divinest rite of Nature's
temple." In other letters, unpublished, that exist, Hearn
is morbidly frank as to sexual licence and practices. In
tropical cities there is "no time for friendship&mdash;only
passion for women, and brief acquaintance for men."
Without the influence of sexualism there can be no real
greatness; "the mind remains arid and desolate," and he
quotes approvingly:&mdash;"Virginity, Mysticism, Melancholy&mdash;three
unknown words, three new maladies brought among
us by the Christ," etc. "I do not find it possible to persuade
myself that the 'mad excess of love' should not be
indulged in by mankind," introduces a brilliant page upon
the theme, ending with, "after all what else do we live for&mdash;ephemeræ
that we are?" To my protest he wrote,
"'Moral' feelings are those into which the sexual instinct
does not visibly enter;" and again, "The sexual sense
never tells a <i>physical</i> lie. It only tells an ethical one."
There is, to be sure, no answer to a man who says such
things.</p>

<p class="indent">It is astonishing, how conscious and at the same time
how careless Hearn was of his characteristics and trends.
In 1878 he could coldly prepare to attempt a get-rich-quick
scheme, "a fraud, which will pay like hell, an advertising
fraud," etc., because "there is no money in honest work."
At this time also he knew that his own wandering passion
was "the strongest of all," and that his deepest desire was
"to wander forever here and there until he should get old
and apish and grey and die." His misfortunes he confessed
were of his own making because it was absolutely
out of the question for him to "keep any single situation
for any great length of time," hating the mere idea of it,
"impossible to stay anywhere without getting into trouble."
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;53]</span>
"No one ever lived who seemed more a creature of circumstance
than I," he correctly avows. He recognizes that
"the unexpected obstacle to success was usually erected
by himself."</p>

<p class="indent">He acknowledges his ignorance and escapes from it and
from the labour, expense, and duty of scholarship by flying,
as many others have done, to the world of Imagination,
which alone is left to him. "It allows of a vagueness of
expression which hides the absence of real knowledge, and
dispenses with the necessity of technical precision and
detail." He "never reads a book which does not powerfully
impress the imagination." Knowing that he has not
true and real genius, he "pledges himself to the worship of
the Odd, the Queer, the Strange, the Exotic, the Monstrous.
It quite suits my temperament," and he "hopes to succeed
in attracting some little attention." The monstrous, the
enormous, and the lurid, is sought in the letters. The sentence
at the bottom of page 226, Volume One of the "Life
and Letters," and the ghastly story, pages 322-323, show
the gruesome still much alive, and page 306 that blood,
fury, and frenzy haunt his nightmare dreams. "In history
one should only seek the extraordinary, the monstrous, the
terrible; in mythology the most fantastic and sensuous,
just as in romance," And yet he defends himself as a
lover of Greek art, detests "the fantastic beauty that is
Gothic," yet prides himself on being Arabesque. Even the
love of Beaudelaire creeps in, and the brutal, horrible
photograph of Gautier is "grander than he imagined." Of
course to such a mind Matthew Arnold is a "colossal
humbug"&mdash;and worse.</p>

<p class="indent">With increasing frequency are repeated the complaints of
disillusionment; he is frightened at the loss even of the love
of the beautiful, and his friend tries in vain to rouse him from
his ghost-life and dreaming. There are absurd excuses why
he cannot work; when among beautiful things he cannot
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;54]</span>
write of them, when he is away he is longing for them;
there are months when he cannot do anything, and a little
thing is produced with great pain and labour. "The old
enthusiasm has completely died out of me." The people
and the city are adequately cursed, and upon the debilitating
climate is laid a proper and ever-repeated anathema.
He loathes the North, especially New York City, "shudders
at the bare idea of cold;" he yearns and pines for a
still more tropical country which he knows may kill him,
and which came near doing so. The <i>Wanderlust</i> is upon
him as passages on pages 183, 193, 196, 197, 207, 215, 223,
224, 398 of Volume One of the "Life and Letters" illustrate.
At last he is off for Martinique, where work and
even thought are still more impossible because of the
benumbing heat.</p>

<p class="cap">THE lure of the Sea and of the Unknown was upon
Hearn during the entire stay at New Orleans. How
deeply it entered his heart is shown in a fragment rescued
by his friend, Dr. Matas, which has been kindly sent me.
The copy is in print, but when and where it was published
we have been unable to learn. It was probably written in
1885 or 1886. As it gives glimpses at once into Hearn's
mind, of his fateful desire to roam, of his Nature-love, and,
better, of his growing mastery of technic and imagery, I
reproduce herewith the fragment, which he entitled:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="center">GULF WINDS</p>

<p class="indent">Golden oranges piled up in bins,&mdash;apples of the Southern Hesperides;&mdash;a
medley of meridional tongues,&mdash;silky Latin tongues and their
silkier patois; Chinese buyers yellow as bananas, quadroons with skin
like dead gold; swarthy sailors from the Antilles; sharp odours of
fruit freshly disembarked;&mdash;all the semi-tropical sights and sounds of
the French market. I stood beside an orange-bin; and priced the
fruit. Fifty cents a hundred! While wondering how much the fruit-vender's
profit could possibly be, I was insensibly attracted by something
unusual in his face&mdash;a shadow of the beauty of the antique world
seemed to rest upon it. "Are you not a Greek?" I asked, for there
was no mistaking the metoposcopy of that head. Yes; he was from
Zante&mdash;first a sailor, now a fruit-vender; some day, perhaps, he would
be a merchant.</p>

<p class="indent">It is among those who sell, not among those who buy, that the most
curious studies of human nature and of the human face are to be made
in the French market. These dealers are by no means usually French,
but they are mostly from the Mediterranean coasts and the Levant&mdash;from
Sicily and Cyprus, Corsica and Malta, the Ionian Archipelago,
and a hundred cities fringing the coasts of Southern Europe. They
are wanderers, who have wandered all over the face of the earth to
find rest at last in this city of the South; they are sailors who have
sailed all seas, and sunned themselves at a hundred tropical ports,
and finally anchored their lives by the levee of New Orleans. The
Neapolitan Italian, the Spaniard, the Corsican, the Levantine Greek,
seek rest from storm here, in a clime akin to their own and under a
sky as divinely blue, and at a port not far distant from their beloved
sea. For these Levantine sailors hate dusty inland cities and the dry
air of the Great West.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;59]</span>
If you, O reader, chance to be a child of the sea;&mdash;if, in early childhood,
you listened each morning and evening to that most ancient
and mystic hymn-chant of the waves, which none can hear without
awe, and which no musician can learn;&mdash;if you have ever watched
wonderingly the far sails of the fishing-vessels turn rosy in the blush
of sunset, or silver under the moon, or golden in the glow of sunrise;&mdash;if
you once breathed as your native air the divine breath of the
ocean, and learned the swimmer's art from the hoary breakers, and
received the Ocean-god's christening, the glorious baptism of salt,&mdash;then,
perhaps, you know only too well why these sailors of the Levant
cannot seek homes within the heart of the land. Twenty years may
have passed since your ears last caught the thunder of that mighty
ode of hexameters which the sea has always sung and will sing forever,
since your eyes sought the far line where the vaulted blue of
heaven touches the level immensity of rolling water,&mdash;since you
breathed the breath of the ocean, and felt its clear ozone living in your
veins like an elixir. Have you forgotten the mighty measure of that
mighty song? have you forgotten the divine saltiness of that unfettered
wind? Is not the spell of the sea strong upon you still?</p>

<p class="indent">So that when the long, burning summer comes, and the city roars
dustily around you, and your ears are filled with the droning hum of
machinery, and your heart full of the bitterness of the struggle for
life, there comes to you at long intervals in the dingy office or the
crowded street some memory of white breakers and vast stretches
of wrinkled sand and far-fluttering breezes that seem to whisper,
"Come!"</p>

<p class="indent">So that when the silent night comes,&mdash;you find yourself revisiting in
dreams those ocean-shores thousands of miles away. The wrinkled
sand, ever shifting yet ever the same, has the same old familiar patches
of vari-coloured weeds and shining rocks along its level expanse: and
the thunder-chant of the sea which echoes round the world, eternal
yet ever new, is rolling up to heaven. The glad waves leap up to
embrace you; the free winds shout welcome in your ears; white
sails are shining in the west; white sea-birds are flying over the
gleaming swells. And from the infinite expanse of eternal sky and
everlasting sea, there comes to you, with the heavenly ocean-breeze,
a thrilling sense of unbounded freedom, a delicious feeling as of life
renewed, an ecstasy as of life restored. And so you start into wakefulness
with the thunder of that sea-dream in your ears and tears of
regret in your eyes to find about you only heat and dust and toil; the
awakening rumble of traffic, and "the city sickening on its own thick
breath."</p>

<p class="indent">And I think that the Levantine sailors dare not dwell in the midst
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;60]</span>
of the land, for fear lest dreams of a shadowy sea might come upon
them in the night, and phantom winds call wildly to them in their
sleep, and they might wake to find themselves a thousand miles beyond
the voice of the breakers.</p>

<p class="indent">Sometimes, I doubt not, these swarthy sellers of fruit, whose black
eyes sparkle with the sparkle of the sea, and whose voices own the
tones of ocean-winds, sicken when a glorious breeze from the Gulf
enters the city, shaking the blossoms from the magnolia-trees and the
orange-groves. Sometimes, I doubt not, they forsake their Southern
home when the dream comes upon them, and take ship for the Spanish
Main. Yet I think most men may wake here from the dreams of the
sea, and rest again. It is true that you cannot hear the voice of the
hoary breakers in the moonlight,&mdash;only the long panting of the cotton-presses,
the shouting of the boats calling upon each other through the
tropical night, and the ceaseless song of night-birds and crickets.
But the sea-ships, with their white wings folded, are slumbering at the
wharves; the sea-winds are blowing through the moon-lit streets, and
from the South arises a wondrous pale glow, like the far reflection of
the emerald green of the ocean. So that the Greek sailor, awaking
from the vision of winds and waves, may join three fingers of his right
hand, after the manner of the Eastern Church, and cross himself, and
sleep again in peace.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">Hearn left New Orleans in July, 1887, and was soon
settled at St. Pierre, Martinique. His letters to Dr. Matas
form the principal sources of information concerning himself
and his work during his stay there. From them I
choose a few selections which bear upon his literary
labours. At first, of course, all is perfection:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">I am absolutely bewitched, and resolved to settle down somewhere
in the West Indies. Martinique is simply heaven on earth. You
must imagine a community whose only vices are erotic. There are
no thieves, no roughs, no snobs. Everything is primitive and morally
pure&mdash;except in the only particular where purity would be out of
harmony with natural conditions. As for the climate, it is divine&mdash;though
this is the worst season.</p>

<p class="indent">And I have begun to hate all that is energetic, swift, rapid in thought
or action, all rivalry, all competition, all striving in the race of success.
It is just enough to live here: no, it is too much!&mdash;it is more than
any ordinary human being deserves to enjoy. It makes one feel like
crying for joy just to look about one.</p>

<p class="indent">Couldn't I induce you to abandon the beastly civilization of the
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;61]</span>
U. S., and live somewhere down here forever more,&mdash;where everybody
is honest and good-natured and courteous, and where everything is
divine? Man was not intended to work in this part of the world:
while you are here, you cannot quite persuade yourself you are awake,&mdash;it
is a dream of eternal beauty,&mdash;all the musky winds, all the flower-months
of Paradise! New Orleans is the most infernal hole in the
entire Cosmos. Don't live in it! Confound fame and wealth and
reputation and splendour. You don't need any of these things here;
they are superfluous; they are obsolete; they are nuisances; they are
living curses. Settle here. Humming-birds will fly into your chamber
to wake you up. What on earth you can find to live for in the U.S.
I am now at a loss to see. You'll get old there;&mdash;here you will remain
eternally young: the palms distil Elixir Vitæ.</p>

<p class="indent">But it is simply foolishness to write to you&mdash;because I can't write
about this place. All ambition to write has been paralyzed&mdash;let Nature
do the writing&mdash;in green, azure and gold!</p>
</blockquote>

From a Photograph taken at Martinique, August 24th, 1888.</span>
</div>

<p class="center">(Letter from St. Pierre, July 30, 1887.)</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">I am not at all sure of my literary future,&mdash;I do not mean pecuniarily,
for I never allow that question to seriously bother me: to write simply
to make money is to be a d&mdash;&mdash;d fraud, so long as one can aim at
higher things. But I do not feel the same impulses and inspirations
and power to create;&mdash;I have been passing through a sort of crisis,&mdash;out
of enthusiasm into reality and I do not feel so mentally strong as
I ought. The climate had much to do with it in the beginning, causing
a serious weakness of memory;&mdash;that is now passed; but I feel as
if <i>mon âme avait perdu ses ailes</i>. Perhaps something healthier and
stronger may come of it; but in the meanwhile I suffer from great
disquietude, and occasional very black ideas; and praise sounds to
me like a malicious joke, because I feel that my work has been damnably
bad. The fact that I <i>know</i> it has been bad, encourages me to
believe I may do better, and find confidence in myself.</p>

<p class="indent">I have enough MS. for a volume of French colonial sketches, and
do not think I will be able to do much more with Martinique for the
present; but I also have accumulated material out of which something
will probably grow. I would now like to attempt some Spanish
studies.</p>

<p class="indent">Northern air will do me good, though I do not like the idea of
living in it. But when, after all this stupid, brutal, never-varying
heat, you steam North, and the constellations change, and the moon
stands up on her feet instead of lying on her back lasciviously,&mdash;and
the first grand whiff of cold air comes like the advent of a Ghost,&mdash;Lord!
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;62]</span>
how one's brain suddenly clears and thrills into working order.
It is like a new soul breathed into your being through the nostrils&mdash;after
the Creator's fashion of animating his Adam of clay.</p>

<p class="indent">Perhaps you think I have been a poor correspondent. You can
scarcely imagine the difficulties of maintaining a friendly chat by
letter while trying to do literary work here. Most people who attempt
literature here either give it up after a short time, or go to the graveyard:
there are a few giants,&mdash;like Dr. Rufz de Lavison (who never
finished his Études nevertheless), Davey the historian; Dessalles who
suddenly disappeared leaving his history incomplete. But I fear I
am no giant. At 2 or 2.30 p.m. if you try to write, your head feels
as if a heated feather pillow had been stuffed into your skull. To
write at all one must utilize the morning;&mdash;that is given to make
the pot boil: one can write letters only at intervals, paragraph
by paragraph, or between solid chapters of downright wearing-out
work.</p>

<p class="indent">Nevertheless, one learns to love this land so much as to be quite
willing to abandon anything and everything to live in it. As in the
old Sunday-school hymn, "only man is vile:" nature and Woman are
unspeakably sweet.</p>

<p class="indent">I suppose I will not be able to meet you in New York this fall: you
will be too busy. Next summer it will be possible, I hope. Perhaps
you will have the pleasure of a little book or two from me during the
cold weather: I will revise things in New York. It has been a
horrible agony to have my stuff printed without being able to see the
proofs, and full of mistakes. "Chita" has been a great literary
success&mdash;contrary to expectation. I find success is not decided by
the press, nor by first effect on the public: opinions of literary men
count much more, and these have been better than I imagined they
could be. (1887)</p>

<p class="indent">Well, I am caught! The tropics have me, for better or worse, so
long as I live. Life in a great northern city again would be a horror
insupportable. Yet I have had great pain here. I have been four months
without a cent of money where nobody would trust me: you know
what that means, if you have ever had a rough-and-tough year or
two: otherwise you could not imagine it. I have had disillusions in
number. I find worst of all, there is no inspiration in the tropics,&mdash;no
poetry, no aspiration, no self-sacrifice, no human effort. Now,
that I can go where I like, do as I please&mdash;for I have won the fight
after all,&mdash;I still prefer one year of Martinique to a thousand years of
New York. What is it? Am I demoralized; or am I simply better
informed than before? I don't really know. (1887)</p>

<p class="indent">Dear Friend Matas:&mdash;I am going back to the tropics,&mdash;probably
for many years. My venture has been more successful than I ever
hoped; and I find myself able to abandon journalism, with all its
pettinesses, cowardices, and selfishnesses, forever. I am able hereafter
to devote myself to what you always said was my <i>forte</i>: the
study of tropical Nature&mdash;God's Nature,&mdash;violent, splendid, nude, and
pure. I never hoped for such fortune. It has come unasked. I am
almost afraid to think it is true. I am afraid to be happy!</p>

119 South Seventeenth St.,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
Philadelphia, June 5, 1889.</p>

<p class="indent">Dear Friend Matas:&mdash;Your letter of March 21 only reached me to-day,
June 5th; but made me very glad to get it. I have been back
from the West Indies about three weeks&mdash;do not know how long I
shall stay. It seemed like tearing my heart out to leave Martinique;
and though I am now in one of the most beautiful cities in the world,
among dear friends, and with the splendid spectacle before me of man's
grandest efforts&mdash;not a wild cyclone of electricity and iron like New
York, but a great quiet peace&mdash;the tropical Nature with all its memories
haunts me perpetually,&mdash;draws my thought back again over the azure
sea and under the turquoise sky to the great palms and the volcanic
hills and the beautiful brown women. I know I shall have to go back
to the tropics sooner or later.</p>

<p class="indent">The effect of the climate, as you know, is deadly to mental work.
Physically, however, I felt better in it,&mdash;less nervous than I ever was
before. Only one's will to work is broken down; and it is better only
to collect material there to work up elsewhere. That sort of work I
am busy at just now. I have a signed contract for publication of
"Chita" in book-form; and the result of my two years' absence will
be forthcoming in a volume of larger size.</p>

<p class="indent">You know Philadelphia, I suppose, the beautiful city; and I suppose
you know that physicians here form the leaders of, and give the tone
to, social life. It seems to me but just that they should,&mdash;representing
the highest intellectual rank of civilization when they are really worthy
of the profession.</p>

<p class="indent">... As for other people wondering what has become of me; that
is just what I want. I do not care to have any one know what I am
doing till it is done.... I have happily got over a sort of crisis,
however, which isolated me more than I would have liked to be isolated
from the world at large: the distrust of myself.</p>

</div>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;64]</span>
Concerning the value of Hearn's Martinique work, I am
permitted to quote from a letter written to him on May 24,
1890, by the late Edmund C. Stedman,&mdash;and there could
be no better judge and critic:</p>

<p class="indent">"I will not leave without telling you how much I am
your debtor for the fascinating copious record of your life
in the Windward Islands, and for your 'Youma'&mdash;both of
which I take with me to 'Kelp Rock'&mdash;and which we shall
know by heart ere long. The 'Two Years' came when I
was 'moving' in New York, etc.,&mdash;so that books and letters,
unacknowledged, perforce have piled up on my table. I
am grateful for your remembrance and your gifts. <i>No</i>
book could please me more than your 'Two Years.' Those
Islands are my Hesperides&mdash;I had begun a series of poems
and lyrics, cast in the Caribees, but your prose poems put
mine to shame&mdash;and I am glad to listen to your music and
leave my own unsung."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI_GETTING_A_SOUL" id="CHAPTER_VI_GETTING_A_SOUL"></a>CHAPTER VI.&mdash;"GETTING A SOUL"</h2>

<hr class="hr2"/>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;66]</span></p>

<p class="cap">SHORT though it was in time, the Philadelphia visit
in 1889 has a value long in significance, that deserves
epitomization. To begin with, it was Hearn's first experience
of anything that might be called home-life. Its
result was a softening and normalizing of him both as
to character and as to manner, which was most evident.
Secondly, and as he chose to put it, I "gave him a soul."
By this poetic paraphrase he meant that I had succeeded
in bringing to his recognition the existence of Freedom in
what he thought determinism;&mdash;that intelligence, purpose,
and beneficence lie behind biology, and that human beings
are not always, and may never be wholly, the slaves of the
senses, and the dupes of desire. Beauty itself, which he
so widely sought, I asked him to note, is a needless, harmful,
and even impossible thing in a world of adamantine
logic and necessity. Above all, I demonstrated the existence
of Duty, "Stern Daughter of the Voice of God," not
only in the abstract, but in concrete lives, in social and
historic exemplifications, and that only by means of men
and women who obey conscience is social and historic
progress brought about. They who have not seen that
can have no "soul;" they who do see it, have soul, durable
or great according to the clearness of the seeing and the
obedience to the implication. Fully and freely Hearn
acknowledged the vision, and never afterward could he be
wholly the same as he had been before. But the Providence
of the Oriental and semi-barbarous is Improvidence, and
their God is Fate. Hearn came to hate, or to pretend
to hate, the truth which had now slipped through his
spiritual eyes, but he could not undo or outroot it entirely;
"henceforth by the vision splendid is on his way attended."
Thirdly, this new viewpoint, this new spirit or soul, I
got incorporated in a little art-work, or ethical study&mdash;"Karma,"
published in <i>Lippincott's Magazine</i>, May, 1890,
after Hearn had gone to Japan. To the world and without
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;67]</span>
the knowledge of its making, "Karma" must have
seemed an illogical and even impossible thing for Hearn to
have written. It is apparently the sole work which he
ever wrote, created <i>de novo</i> and without the data having
been found or brought to him from without. But it was
only a seeming creation. It was only the telling, the
colouring, that was his, as in his other tales before or
after. In our long walks and talks in the Park at night,
we wrought out the title, the datum, and the whole trend
of the story. He rebelled, but I held him to the task,
which he finally executed with frank and artistic loyalty.
The pride or indifference, even the dislike, of its readers,
the writer, or inspirer, is as nothing compared with the
fact that by it and from it Hearn learned something of
love and duty that had never before been a living reality
to him. What an infinite distance it was removed from
anything dreamed during the Cincinnati period, or to be
derived from Flaubert, Gautier, or Beaudelaire! After that
his future work could never be, and never was, what it was
from the writing, "<i>Everything you feel you would not like
me to know.</i>" I do not think there is exaggeration of the
importance of the story, and what led up to its writing, in
saying that it was the greatest of the turning-points in his
life, and that directly because of it the magnificent works
of the Japanese period were profoundly influenced through
the attitude of mind thereby gained.</p>

<p class="indent">Concerning the heroine of the tale Hearn wrote me:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">Your objection to my idea is quite correct. I have already
abandoned it. It would have to be sexual. Never could find in
the tropics that magnificent type of womanhood, which in the New
England girl, makes one afraid even to think about sex, while
absolutely adoring the personality. Perfect natures inspire a love
that is a fear. I don't think any love is noble without it. The tropical
woman inspires a love that is half compassion; this is always
dangerous, untrustworthy, delusive&mdash;pregnant with future pains
innumerable.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;68]</span>
But, fourthly, that in which I feel as great a pride, is
compelling him to go to Japan. Others could have
reported for lurid yellow journalism, others might possibly
have translated as well as he, others could have told the
West Indian stories, but&mdash;not even his beloved Lowell&mdash;only
Hearn could have written of the Japanese life and
soul as Hearn has done. He had no thought of the
journey when I showed him his duty and his opportunity.
By argument, pleading, almost compulsion, I at last
wearied his opposition, and he went, with reluctance, after
months of halting in detested New York City in which he
learned by bitter experience that it was no place for him,
and that his beloved tropics should not be again sought.</p>

<p class="indent">How disappointed he was in his New York friends and
prospects may be gathered from the following excerpt
taken from one of his letters to me. I had used all my
influence to keep him from a stay in the city. He wrote
as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">Dear Gooley, your advice is good from your way of looking at it;
but I am much stronger in New York than you imagine, and my
future in it is plain and perfect sailing if I keep good health. I am
only embarrassed for the moment. I am quite a lion here, and could
figure in a way you would hardly guess, if I were not such a man of
tentacles. I am not afraid of the cold&mdash;though it disheartens fancy a
little; but I shall leave fancy alone for a while. No, Gooley, dear
Gooley, I shall make my way in New York&mdash;don't be afraid for me.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">He soon became convinced that I was right and finally
resumed the journey unwillingly. The end has justified
the means and the sacrifices. It is plain that the Japanese
period and work crown his life-labours splendidly, and that
his masterful pictures of Japanese characters, traditions,
and religion now constitute one of our most precious
literary treasures. They have also been of profound
service to Japan.</p>

<p class="indent">When he left my home, he, of his own accord, asked me
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;69]</span>
to care for his library, then in the home of Mr. Alden at
Metuchen, New Jersey, who two years previously had
consented to take charge of it, and had paid shipping
expenses, insurance, etc. None can imagine anything
ungenerous or unkind in Mr. Alden. An old Cincinnati
acquaintance characterizes Hearn's action in the matter as
"a swindle." I have no knowledge or hint how it was or
could be of that nature. Hearn wrote all the letters, and
made all the arrangements to have the books sent to me.
Mr. Alden authorizes me to say:</p>

<p class="indent">"I was perfectly convinced at the time of the transfer
of the library to Dr. Gould that he had no desire for its
possession, and that the transfer was made solely in
accordance with Mr. Hearn's request. I am quite sure
that Dr. Gould fully explained the matter to me at the
time. I feel sure that Dr. Gould acted precisely as I
should have done if I had retained possession of the
library; that is, readily giving it up to any legitimate
claimant." I found the books of no value to me, and they
surely have been an expense. I tried, later, to prevail
upon Hearn to allow me to ship them to him in Japan, but
I never received any replies to my letters. He asked for the
catalogue, some of the old books, and beside these, at his
request, a number of expensive new books were at various
times bought and sent to him. I suspect that as there
was not a book on Japan in the collection, and as he had
a plethora of data at hand such as he wanted, the library
gathered with so much love and enthusiasm was no longer
of use to him, especially under the conditions of his life
there.</p>

<p class="indent">Hearn gained strength and power as regards both truth
and art, in so far as he was true to the better in himself;
all his trouble and his weakness were born out of the lower
self he would not, or could not, sacrifice. His worship of
the blood-curdling and revolting gave him some temporary
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;70]</span>
vogue among the readers of yellow newspaperdom, but not
until that was renounced for the compromise of the "odd
and ghostly" did he begin to show an ability to reach something
more worthy in human nature than the degenerate
reporter catered to. The next step in advance was the
cultivation of the artistic pornography of the sensualistic
French story-writer. Not until he renounced this did he
once more come to the something of more use to the
reading world which fills the Martinique epoch. His disinclination
to go to Japan, I more than suspect, was owing
to a half consciousness that there was in that nation too
much civilization, too good character, and even too much
religion to suit the tastes which had been uppermost
in motiving his past literary labours. His going into
utter, illogical, and absurd captivity to the atheistic and
materialistic philosophy of Herbert Spencer was a sorry
sacrifice of his nobler office and better destiny to the fate
that relentlessly dogged his footsteps. He was forced
into all the humanity and beneficence possible to him by
Japanese restraint, art, and truth. His cries of disillusion
over the Japanese were largely the anger of the semi-barbaric
wanderer held by family ties, paternity, etc., when
he found himself prevented from again seeking the faraway
tropical pseudo-paradises of peoples but one remove
from savagery.</p>

<p class="indent">In the pre-Japanese periods only the lurid, the monstrous,
the enormous, only hot crime, and sexual passion, could
excite his liveliest interest, and all great literature was as
much ignored as if it did not exist. There is not a hint
in all he did that he had read a line of the great creators
of literature,&mdash;the Greek dramatists, Dante, Goethe, Shakespere,
and a hundred more; he could not give time to
read, much less study them. His pretension of ability to
teach English literature was soon recognized even by the
Japanese, and it is well that over-zealous friends did not
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;71]</span>
secure him a lectureship at Cornell University. To be
sure, he never had time to study even the history of his
own science and art,&mdash;but he never would have done so,
it is plain, if leisure and opportunity had been offered him.
The ideal and the rewards of scholarship never entered
his mind. Perhaps it was best for his peculiar office and
proficiency that he allowed all erudition to go unlooked-upon.
And yet if he had been possessed of sufficient
virility and objectivity of mind to have learned the
Japanese language, what would the labour not have been
worth? That he could not read a Japanese book or
newspaper after fourteen years of life among the people is
most disconcerting. It is a tribute to the amazing delicacy
and receptiveness of his mind that while he could not
speak to his wife or children in their own tongue, he should
still have so accurately caught the Japanese spirit and so
admirably conveyed it to us.</p>

<p class="indent">The history of Hearn's ghoulish pleasure in the gruesome
and sensualistic, runs from the tan-yard horror and Cincinnati
reportorial days, through the translated stories of
the New Orleans epoch, to his "St. Anthony." In "Stray
Leaves" it is but little softened, and yet the atmosphere
is brightening. It glitters and flashes like vengeful lightning
about the clouds of his mind with the Martinique epoch,
etc.; but in the Japanese writing even the "Mountain of
Skulls" and other stories are so far removed from reality
that our disgust sinks to a smile of sighing wonder that the
gruesome could still be so loved by him. It is only a few
of the brutal and a small brutalized public that seeks such
<i>contes drolatiques</i> (without Balzac's wit, satire, and power,
of course), and so again perforce, Hearn was weaned from
his morbidities. Dominated by his developing art and
also by the need to sell his writings, he thus rose, partly
by the command of his readers, to the choice of less and
less repulsive themes and methods, and, awed by the
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;72]</span>
Japanese spirit of gentleness and beauty, he finally endowed
their national soul-life with a prismatic glory which
they themselves had hardly suspected.</p>

<p class="indent">Hearn deserted the god of religion, and, except in one
respect, he was faithless to the god of ethics. He was,
therefore, without any divinity. For a mind that had no
creative ability, that <i>must</i> have its <i>subjects</i> furnished to it,
a mind whose sole function was to colour the data chosen
or given from without,&mdash;this inner emptiness could only be
deceived by but could not be satisfied with the inner
emptiness of Spencerism. He acknowledged that religion
was the mother of all civilization, arts, and laws, and that
all social systems, arts, and laws, antique or modern, were
begotten and nurtured by ethics,&mdash;and yet there was no
reality in, no reason for the existence of either religion or
ethics in this world of mechanics and of fatalism, grim and
inexorable.</p>

<p class="indent">Hearn speaks somewhere of his aspiration to be considered
a "thinker," and once he praises "science" as a
source of data for working into the art forms of his beloved
poetic prose. But science to him was as impossible as
was he to polite society; Spencer gave him leave, he
thought, to consider his atheism, irreligion, and sensualisticism
as scientifically authorized, and logically justified.
He was always hankering after the old heathen, even
savage, gods of his father and mother; and every time he
went Fantee with them, he came back to a saner world
weakened and still more at war with himself. He always
sought an impossible world where Teutonic worth and
honour could supply a decadent Latin, with half-savage
languor and never failing delights of the senses and of
art,&mdash;art which, in the last analysis, was his only god.
But his tragedy was that he always hastened to turn his
god into a fetich, while even his mind caught disquieting
glimpses of the awful truth that all genuine worship
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;73]</span>
abjures fetichism. As sensualism is the superstition of
love, so fetichistic art is the superstition of true æsthetics.</p>

<p class="indent">For the most part, minds are mechanical not chemical
compoundings, or if chemic, they are in very unstable equilibrium.
There are strange and wayward traits, illogic and
unfused to unity with the others. There may be psychopathic
and isolation wards in the psyche, "retreats," and
all manner of diseases of individual organs. Most people
go Fantee, often or seldom, and are able to hide their
fetichisms from even their best friends. If we observe
ourselves at all, most of us wonder at the curious mix of
self-contradictories in ourselves. The few whose souls and
bodies are fused to clear-cut unity, the component metal
melted to harmony in the foundry of Fate and of Purpose,&mdash;these
clang loyally in absolute and precise tone-colour.
In commoner folk the failure of the flux, and the flaws in
the casting, have only a social significance, but with the
Hearns, with thinkers and writers, the affair has an infinite
purport.</p>

<p class="indent">Hearn could never make his writings and his art impulses
square with his beloved materialistic, deterministic
philosophy. He did not believe in soul or in souls, and yet
his soul was always treating of souls, and showing the
invisible thread of continuity which links souls to Soul.
Therefore he is always happiest when his <i>daimon</i> breaks
from the restraint of theory and fate and pictures the play
of free spirit, of soul unconquered by fate, of life victorious
over death in some sad way or bright.</p>

<p class="indent">Concerning Hearn's treatment of friends, editors, and
publishers, as it bears sharply upon his literary character
and productivity, as little as may or must be said: He was
under bonds to Fate to abuse worst the majority of his
friends who were most magnanimous, helpful, and kind to
him personally, or who were most discriminating and
encouraging toward his art and artistic ideals. To his
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;74]</span>
former Cincinnati comrades, except the old printer-friend,
he scarcely ever wrote after he left them, and the most
faithful of these recently writes me: "I never pretended to
be a friend to him; I was merely one to whom he resorted
when all the rest cast him out. He never found me
wanting, but he got few letters from me, and none that
were flattering." "I used to love Matas" are Hearn's
pitiful words. It is with sorrow and pain that we note the
sudden cessation in 1887 of the letters to Krehbiel. This
noble friend had drawn from Hearn a beautiful world of
play and enduring memories, and one may be more than
sure that it was not Krehbiel who should be blamed.
Baker had been his most helpful and best friend, and yet for
a fancied wrong Hearn wrote him a letter filled with insult
and ruffianism which a gentleman could not answer, hardly
forgive, and never forget. Did Hearn know anybody of
character in the West Indies? To the greatest of
American editors, the one who "discovered" him and
introduced him to a national and international audience,
who treated him with a sweet and gracious benignity, even
after a shamelessness that is indescribable&mdash;to this good
man there is not a published letter, although many, and
many more, must exist. One day while at my house,
Hearn rushed to his room, seized the man's picture on the
wall, tore it in a hundred pieces, and danced and spat upon
it in a furious rage. In subsequent letters to me he explained
his hatred&mdash;how he broke his engagements, how he
borrowed money from his loathed and insulted friend, how
he got credit through him from his tailor, etc. Gently the
abused one bore it all and without the least remonstrance,
writing me, "Hearn has utterly cast me off; I was loath to
part with him." Professor Chamberlain and others kindly
explain the curious morbid psychology which Hearn had
exhibited towards them. To the last, love and trust
breathed from Hearn's letters to me, and yet I learn that
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;75]</span>
to others long afterward he wrote of me with bitterness
and malevolent injustice. And yet he had written me after
I saw him for the last time, in this way: "Please don't
write me at all, or expect me to write, for some months.
I do not need any money. I have a good deal on my
mind, and am apt, in consequence, to do very stupid or
very unkind things in an unlucky moment." And then he
wrote: "No, dear Gooley, I will never be indifferent to
you! Never think that; I understand better than you
suppose. If I am silent at intervals, never doubt me, dear
teacher and brother; and you will find everything come
right." How often is the pathos of life sadly exaggerated
by giving way to foolish, needless, and degrading inherited
instincts at the expense of the higher life and usefulness!
As to some who ludicrously boast of the long continuance
of an intimate friendship, there are many letters of Hearn
extant and unpublished which blow out that vanity with
an amusing smile. The matter, generally, might not have
so real an importance were it not that the publishing of
literature has a vast deal to do with literature, and, closely
examined, Hearn's quarrels with editors, publishers, and
the public, is a matter that reaches out astonishingly both
as regards himself, his books, and the interest in him, as
well as beyond the question of Hearn or of any or all of
his friends. Until one silent man consents to speak&mdash;which
may never be&mdash;the discussion of the essence of the
affair cannot be set forth in any detail. Passages in
Hearn's letters relating thereto should never have been
published, or a hundred other things should have been as
frankly published. When such publicity shall exist the
reasons will be manifest why one publisher destroyed an
entire fresh edition of one book of Hearn, why another
acted differently, why one is praised or praises himself,
why others are blamed, why some are silent although a
word would end the injustice, etc. One phase may be
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;76]</span>
noted in passing:&mdash;Whatever Hearn's rights or wrongs as
to the author's relations with publishers and editors, it was
beyond the ken of his mind that one who may gloriously
sacrifice all his own temporal blessings in striving after
artistic excellence, has no right to ask the same altruism
of those engaged in the publishing business. Hearn
blamed the crude world, and, for him, its representatives
in the persons of editors and their masters, the publishers,
for wishing a certain kind of literature. As well blame
the bookseller for not sending the book you had not
ordered. He who deliberately chooses to give the world
a literature he knows it does not want, must accept the
rejection and editing of his manuscripts, and the absence
of the world's cheques. He chose poverty and may not
abuse them who allowed his choice to be realized. It is
sad enough, but it is more than childish to grumble, more
than ignoble to rail.</p>

<p class="indent">The search for "inspiration," as he called it, was with
Hearn constant and lifelong. Thus, early in his career, he
wrote to his friend, Dr. Matas:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">So I wait for the poet's Pentecost&mdash;the inspiration of Nature&mdash;the
descent of the Tongues of Fire. And I think they will come when
the wild skies brighten, and the sun of the Mexican Gulf reappears
for his worshippers&mdash;with hymns of wind and sea, and the prayers of
birds. When one becomes bathed in this azure and gold air&mdash;saturated
with the perfume of the sea, he can't help writing <i>something</i>.
And he cannot help feeling a new sense of being. The Soul of the
Sea mingles with his own, is breathed into him: the Spirit that
moveth over the deep is the Creator indeed&mdash;vivifying, illuminating,
strengthening. I really feel his Religion&mdash;the sense of awe that
comes to one in some great silent temple. You would feel it too
under this eternal vault of blue, when the weird old Sea is touching
the keys of his mighty organ....</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And again he wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">I think I <i>must</i> get inspiration. The real secret of art is feeling.
The highest form of that feeling is that which the splendour of
Nature gives&mdash;the thrill and awe of terrible beauty. This is that
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;77]</span>
inexplicable communication of the mind with the Unknowable that
has created the religious sense. Said a friend to me yesterday, who
is not a believer:&mdash;"I stood in the Alps at sunrise, and I knew what
religion meant." And I think that passage in Wilson on Fetichism
superb where he says that the sight of the splendid sky first created the
religious sense. Terribly perverted this sense has been, no doubt;
but it belongs, I fancy, to those things which are eternal, and will
have many a glorious avatar before our planet floats off into the
cemetery of dead worlds. It is, I believe, the most powerful possible
motive for true modern poetry&mdash;in harmony with science and scientific
faith; and that is what I am going to look for.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">Such quotations could be multiplied indefinitely, but
toward the end they become begging, and moaning in
character. The "inspiration" is diligently hunted, hungrily
waited for; at last the failure in its coming grows pitiful
and tragic. For what is inspiration? If, with the fatal
fashion of our fashionable fatalism, we think "we have
outgrown all that," all that which was real and genuine
inspiring, we at least cannot outgrow that which bred the
belief in the inspiring, the trust in spirit and in spiritual
truths and forces. Is it all primitive childishness, this faith
in a real breathing-in of the higher life into our more
carnal hearts and minds? Far from it! It is the veriest
of verities, and the <i>deniers</i> of the conditions of inspiration
dry up the springs of that "inspiration" which they so
hungrily seek. The semblance cannot be without the
reality. It will not come, lasting and inexhaustible, by
any trick of literary technic. Out of the light of common
day is not born that which never was on any sea or shore.
Place, time, circumstance, are not, as Hearn thought, the
gods of "Inspiration." "The wind bloweth where it
listeth," and even a heathen god would hardly visit the
altar with his sacred fire if the priests mocked at the power
and the very existence of the deity. It is most plain that
Hearn early and zealously studied the Bible&mdash;hundreds
of allusions bear witness of the fact&mdash;and that he learned
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;78]</span>
from it the revivification of words, the use of phrase,
metaphor, belief, something of the art of reaching in toward
the depths of men's moral and religious nature and experience:
but all, just so evidently, as a literary art, a <i>tour de
force</i>, the skill of the expert workman, handling them as
symbols for the sake of the skill, while smiling scornfully
at any belief in their reality. Language is the most spirit-like
creation of man's mind, the thing nearest him, woven
out of his own soul-substance, instinct with his life, haunted
with his love, his hate, his suffering. Playing with words,
using them as art-stuff, regardless of the experience and
love and suffering which gave them conceiving and gives
them quickening, is likely to bring upon the artist a sad
revenge. Pleading in vain for "inspiration," Hearn died a
score or more of years before he should have died.</p>

<p class="indent">It should be emphasized that Hearn had but one possible
way, chosen or compelled, to make a living. His terrible
myopia shut him out from every calling except that of a
writer. Moreover, leaving aside the danger to his little
vision from so much ocular labour, he had other and
almost insurmountable handicaps as a poet or maker of
literature: He had no original thing to say, for he was
entirely without creative power, and had always to borrow
theme and plot. Then he had never seen form, knew
almost nothing of it as it exists out there, so that his sole
technic was that of a colourist, and also to endow our dead
and dying words with life&mdash;a "ghostly" life it was, and as
he chose it to be&mdash;but living it assuredly was. That he
over-coloured his pictures, that he over-sensualized his
words, of this there is no question&mdash;but monotones and
senescents that we are, let us not smile too superciliously!
Let us learn; and above all let us enjoy!</p>

<p class="indent">For, his alone was the palette of the painter of the afterglow
of Earth's last sunset. And his the unique miracle
of clothing with the hues of a hopeless rainbow, the faint
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;79]</span>
reverberations of bells far sunk in the wreck and wrack of
ruined centuries; of reintoning the prayers of Nirvâna-entering
souls; of remoaning dear ancient and expiring
griefs; of seeing with shut eyes the sad smiles of never-answered
loves and never-meeting lovers. With him,
hushed, we hearken to Muezzin Bilâl's call from his tower,
to the broken sobs of a dancing-girl's passion, or to the
plaintive beggings of dying babes for the cold breasts of
dead mothers.</p>

<p class="cap">PERHAPS I should not have succeeded in getting
Hearn to attempt Japan had it not been for a little
book that fell into his hands during the stay with me.
Beyond question, Mr. Lowell's volume had a profound
influence in turning his attention to Japan and greatly
aided me in my insistent urging him to go there. In
sending the book Hearn wrote me this letter:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">Gooley!&mdash;I have found a marvellous book,&mdash;a book of books!&mdash;a
colossal, splendid, godlike book. You must read every line of it.
Tell me how I can send it. For heaven's sake don't skip a word
of it. The book is called "The Soul of the Far East," but its title
is smaller than its imprint.</p>

<p class="indent">P.S.&mdash;Let something else go to H&mdash;, and read this book instead.
May God eternally bless and infinitely personalize the man who wrote
this book! Please don't skip one solitary line of it, and don't delay
reading it,&mdash;because something, much! is going to go out of this book
into your heart and life and stay there! I have just finished this
book and feel like John in Patmos,&mdash;only a d&mdash;&mdash;d sight better. He

<p class="indent">There is not much to say about the Japanese period.
The splendid books speak for themselves. There is little

There is one short page<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> which is worth the remainder
of the book. The development of inborn characteristics
goes on, despite the grafted soul, almost as fatalistically as
Hearn would have wished, and in this instance in accordance
with his theory of the unalterability of character. But this
period is of surpassing interest solely because of the beautiful
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;83]</span>
books and articles written. To analyze them is both

<p class="indent">Hearn's views and practices as regards love and the
feminine are not of sympathetic interest to those who
think that monogamy is good and advisable. He hopes
his son will not follow in his father's footsteps as regards
every damozel in his path, and in this respect become
the "disgraceful person he [the father] used to be." He
"half suspects" the Oriental husband is right in loving
his wife least of all others related to or dependent upon
him, and quotes approvingly unquotable things about the
laws of (sexual) nature, managing, <i>more suo</i>, to make
beautiful the pursuit of beauty "in vain." Than the other,
the woman-beauty of soul is the lesser. "It doesn't make
a man any happier to have an intellectual wife. The less
intellectual the more lovable,&mdash;for intellectual converse a
man <i>can't</i> have with women." When contemplating legal
marriage with "his wife" in 1892, he calculates shrewdly
the advantages of the plan. He arrived in Japan in 1890
and in less than two years "my little wife and I have saved
nearly 2,000 Japanese dollars between us." When he has
made her independent he will quit teaching, and "wander
about awhile and write 'sketches' at $10.00 per page." In
1893 he found difficulties in registering the birth of his son.
Hearn was still a British subject. If the boy should be a
Japanese citizen, the registry must be in the mother's name;
if in the father's name, he would become a foreigner. To
become a Japanese citizen would mean for Hearn a great
reduction in his salary as a teacher under Government pay.
"Why was I so foolish as to have a son?" "Really <i>I</i>
don't know." In 1895 he "cuts the puzzle" by becoming a
Japanese citizen, "losing all chance of Government employment
at a living salary." Immediately Hearn "hopes to see
a United Orient yet bound into one strong alliance against
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;84]</span>
our cruel Western Civilization," "against what is called
Society and what is called Civilization."</p>

<p class="indent">For those who boasted of being his friends, it seems an
astonishing thing that they should make Hearn portray
his vices, his moral nakedness, so publicly. Of course he
did not dream of the <i>exposé</i>. It is to his merit, however,
that he would place the truth boldly and baldly before
his friends. He confesses that the scandalous parts of a
book are what he likes best, that he is "a Fraud," "a
vile Latin," etc.,&mdash;"<i>Vive le monde antique!</i>" He is "<i>not
respectable</i>." "Carpets&mdash;pianos&mdash;windows&mdash;curtains&mdash;brass
bands&mdash;churches! how I hate them!! Would I had been
born savage; the curse of civilized cities is upon me."
He admits that he "cannot understand the moral side, of
course," and urges that "the most serious necessity of life
is not to take the moral side of it seriously. We must play
with it, as with an <i>hetaira</i>." It is needless to add that
in this composition and resolve lay Hearn's weakness, his
tragedy, and his missing of "greatness." A man so willed
must finally see that it is the source of pitiful instabilities
and waywardness. "I have been at heart everything by
turns." He learns the old trick of blaming "Fate" and
"the other fellow;" he is hard-pushed, ignored, starved,
morally humiliated:&mdash;"the less a man has to do with
his fellow-men the better;" "it becomes plain why men
cannot be good to one another;" character may not be
bettered or changed; "no line exists between life and
not-life;" "likes and dislikes never depart;" if Spanish,
Italian, or French (instead of English, German, or American)
he "can be at home with a villain," etc. Finally
there comes that burst of frankness:&mdash;"I have more
smallness in me than you can suspect. How could it
be otherwise! If a man lives like a rat for twenty or
twenty-five years, he must have acquired something of
the disposition peculiar to house-rodents,&mdash;mustn't he?"
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;85]</span>
Then increase the complaints of "treachery," the wish for
"justice," the desire to go away, somewhere, anywhere;
and the limit of the amazing is reached in praising <i>The
Conservator</i> and <i>The Whim</i> for bravery and goodness,
and in hating Virchow thoroughly. Was Virchow so
loathsome because this great scientist found an impassable
demarcation between life and the not-life?&mdash;"all cells
are derived from cells." Is it surprising that his old
imagined enemies, the Jesuits, are believed to be hidden
in every place, lurking to thwart every ambition or success,
even to kill him?<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p class="indent">No man is wholly bad who loves children, none wholly
good who does not love them. In a nation of child-lovers,
as Hearn's Japanese writings bear witness, he began to
catch glimpses of truth hitherto unrecognized. Concerning
his eldest son (a fourth child was expected in 1903) Hearn
wrote: "No man can possibly know what life means until
he has a child and loves it. And then the whole Universe
changes,&mdash;and nothing will ever again seem exactly as
it seemed before." Naturally he was drawn to the rich
child-lore and fairy tales of Japan. With great difficulty
I have secured copies of a number of fairy stories edited
by him and published in Japan by T. Hasegawa, T&#333;ky&#333;,
in a style beautiful and dainty beyond superlatives. As
mine are probably the only ones in our country, I have
ventured to copy herewith two of the tales:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="center">THE OLD WOMAN WHO LOST HER DUMPLING</p>

<p class="indent">Long, long ago, there was a funny old woman, who liked to laugh
and to make dumplings of rice-flour.</p>

<p class="indent">One day, while she was preparing some dumplings for dinner, she
let one fall; and it rolled into a hole in the earthen floor of her little
kitchen and disappeared. The old woman tried to reach it by
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;86]</span>
putting her hand down the hole, and all at once the earth gave way,
and the old woman fell in.</p>

<p class="indent">She fell quite a distance, but was not a bit hurt; and when she
got up on her feet again, she saw that she was standing on a road,
just like the road before her house. It was quite light down there;
and she could see plenty of rice-fields, but no one in them. How all
this happened, I cannot tell you. But it seems that the old woman
had fallen into another country.</p>

<p class="indent">The road she had fallen upon sloped very much; so, after having
looked for her dumpling in vain, she thought it must have rolled
farther away down the slope. She ran down the road to look, crying:</p>

<p class="indent">"My dumpling, my dumpling! Where is that dumpling of mine?"</p>

<p class="indent">After a little while she saw a stone Jizo standing by the roadside,
and she said:</p>

<p class="indent">"O Lord Jizo, did you see my dumpling?"</p>

<p class="indent">Jizo answered:</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, I saw your dumpling rolling by me down the road. But you
had better not go any farther, because there is a wicked Oni living
down there, who eats people."</p>

<p class="indent">But the old woman only laughed, and ran on farther down the road,
crying: "My dumpling, my dumpling! Where is that dumpling of
mine?" And she came to another statue of Jizo, and asked it:</p>

<p class="indent">"O kind Lord Jizo, did you see my dumpling?"</p>

<p class="indent">And Jizo said:</p>

<p class="indent">"Yes, I saw your dumpling go by a little while ago. But you must
not run any farther, because there is a wicked Oni down there, who
eats people."</p>

<p class="indent">But she only laughed, and ran on, still crying out: "My dumpling,
my dumpling! Where is that dumpling of mine?" And she came
to a third Jizo, and asked it:</p>

<p class="indent">"O dear Lord Jizo, did you see my dumpling?"</p>

<p class="indent">But Jizo said:</p>

<p class="indent">"Don't talk about your dumpling now. Here is the Oni coming.
Squat down here behind my sleeve, and don't make any noise."</p>

<p class="indent">Presently the Oni came very close, and stopped and bowed to Jizo,
and said:</p>

<p class="indent">"Good-day, Jizo San!"</p>

<p class="indent">Jizo said good-day, too, very politely.</p>

<p class="indent">Then the Oni suddenly snuffed the air two or three times in a
suspicious way, and cried out: "Jizo San, Jizo San! I smell a smell
of mankind somewhere&mdash;don't you?"</p>

<p class="indent">"Oh!" said Jizo, "perhaps you are mistaken."</p>

<p class="indent">"No, no!" said the Oni, after snuffing the air again, "I smell a
smell of mankind."</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;87]</span>
Then the old woman could not help laughing, "Te-he-he!"&mdash;and
the Oni immediately reached down his big hairy hand behind Jizo's
sleeve, and pulled her out,&mdash;still laughing, "Te-he-he!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Ah! ha!" cried the Oni.</p>

<p class="indent">Then Jizo said:</p>

<p class="indent">"What are you going to do with that good old woman? You must
not hurt her."</p>

<p class="indent">"I won't," said the Oni. "But I will take her home with me to
cook for us."</p>

<p class="indent">"Very well," said Jizo; "but you must really be kind to her. If
you are not I shall be very angry."</p>

<p class="indent">"I won't hurt her at all," promised the Oni; "and she will only
have to do a little work for us every day. Good-bye, Jizo San."</p>

<p class="indent">Then the Oni took the old woman far down the road, till they came
to a wide deep river, where there was a boat, and took her across the
river to his house. It was a very large house. He led her at once
into the kitchen, and told her to cook some dinner for himself and the
other Oni who lived with him. And he gave her a small wooden
rice-paddle, and said:</p>

<p class="indent">"You must always put only one grain of rice into the pot, and
when you stir that one grain of rice in the water with this paddle, the
grain will multiply until the pot is full."</p>

<p class="indent">So the old woman put just one rice-grain into the pot, as the Oni
told her, and began to stir it with the paddle; and, as she stirred,
the one grain became two,&mdash;then four,&mdash;then eight,&mdash;then sixteen,&mdash;thirty-two,
sixty-four, and so on. Every time she moved the paddle
the rice increased in quantity; and in a few minutes the great pot was
full.</p>

<p class="indent">After that, the funny old woman stayed a long time in the house of
the Oni, and every day cooked food for him and for all his friends.
The Oni never hurt or frightened her, and her work was made quite
easy by the magic paddle&mdash;although she had to cook a very, very
great quantity of rice, because an Oni eats much more than any
human being eats.</p>

<p class="indent">But she felt lonely, and always wished very much to go back to her
own little house, and make her dumplings. And one day, when the
Oni were all out somewhere, she thought she would try to run away.</p>

<p class="indent">She first took the magic paddle, and slipped it under her girdle;
and then she went down to the river. No one saw her; and the boat
was there. She got into it, and pushed off; and as she could row
very well, she was soon far away from the shore.</p>

<p class="indent">But the river was very wide; and she had not rowed more than
one-fourth of the way across, when the Oni, all of them, came back
to the house.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;88]</span>
They found that their cook was gone, and the magic paddle too.
They ran down to the river at once, and saw the old woman rowing
away very fast.</p>

<p class="indent">Perhaps they could not swim: at all events they had no boat; and
they thought the only way they could catch the funny old woman
would be to drink up all the water of the river before she got to the
other bank. So they knelt down, and began to drink so fast that
before the old woman was half way over, the water had become
quite low.</p>

<p class="indent">But the old woman kept on rowing until the water had got so
shallow that the Oni stopped drinking, and began to wade across.
Then she dropped her oar, took the magic paddle from her girdle,
and shook it at the Oni, and made such funny faces that the Oni all
burst out laughing.</p>

<p class="indent">But the moment they laughed, they could not help throwing up all
the water they had drunk, and so the river became full again. The
Oni could not cross; and the funny old woman got safely over to the
other side, and ran away up the road as fast as she could.</p>

<p class="indent">She never stopped running until she found herself at home again.
After that she was very happy; for she could make dumplings whenever
she pleased. Besides, she had the magic paddle to make rice
for her. She sold her dumplings to her neighbours and passengers,
and in quite a short time she became rich.</p>

<p class="center">THE BOY WHO DREW CATS</p>

<p class="indent">A long, long time ago, in a small country-village in Japan, there
lived a poor farmer and his wife, who were very good people. They
had a number of children, and found it very hard to feed them all.
The elder son was strong enough when only fourteen years old to help
his father; and the little girls learned to help their mother almost as
soon as they could walk.</p>

<p class="indent">But the youngest child, a little boy, did not seem to be fit for hard
work. He was very clever,&mdash;cleverer than all his brothers and sisters;
but he was quite weak and small, and people said he could never
grow very big. So his parents thought it would be better for him to
become a priest than to become a farmer. They took him with them
to the village-temple one day, and asked the good old priest who lived
there, if he would have their little boy for his acolyte, and teach him
all that a priest ought to know.</p>

<p class="indent">The old man spoke kindly to the lad, and asked him some hard
questions. So clever were the answers that the priest agreed to take
the little fellow into the temple as an acolyte, and to educate him for
the priesthood.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;89]</span>
The boy learned quickly what the old priest taught him, and was
very obedient in most things. But he had one fault. He liked to
draw cats during study-hours, and to draw cats even when cats ought
not to have been drawn at all.</p>

<p class="indent">Whenever he found himself alone, he drew cats. He drew them on
the margins of the priest's books, and on all the screens of the temple,
and on the walls, and on the pillars. Several times the priest told
him this was not right; but he did not stop drawing cats. He drew
them because he could not really help it. He had what is called "the
genius of an artist," and just for that reason he was not quite fit to be
an acolyte;&mdash;a good acolyte should study books.</p>

<p class="indent">One day after he had drawn some very clever pictures of cats upon
a paper screen, the old priest said to him severely: "My boy, you
must go away from this temple at once. You will never make a good
priest, but perhaps you will become a great artist. Now let me give
you a last piece of advice, and be sure you never forget it: 'Avoid
large places at night;&mdash;keep to small.'"</p>

<p class="indent">The boy did not know what the priest meant by saying, "Avoid
large places,&mdash;keep to small." He thought and thought, while he was
tying up his little bundle of clothes to go away; but he could not
understand those words, and he was afraid to speak to the priest any
more, except to say good-bye.</p>

<p class="indent">He left the temple very sorrowfully, and began to wonder what he
should do. If he went straight home, he felt sure his father would
punish him for having been disobedient to the priest: so he was
afraid to go home. All at once he remembered that at the next
village, twelve miles away, there was a very big temple. He had
heard there were several priests at that temple; and he made up his
mind to go to them and ask them to take him for their acolyte.</p>

<p class="indent">Now that big temple was closed up, but the boy did not know this
fact. The reason it had been closed up was that a goblin had
frightened the priests away, and had taken possession of the place.
Some brave warriors had afterwards gone to the temple at night to
kill the goblin; but they had never been seen alive again. Nobody
had ever told these things to the boy; so he walked all the way to the
village, hoping to be kindly treated by the priests.</p>

<p class="indent">When he got to the village, it was already dark, and all the people
were in bed; but he saw the big temple on a hill at the other end of
the principal street, and he saw there was a light in the temple.
People who tell the story say the goblin used to make that light, in
order to tempt lonely travellers to ask for shelter. The boy went at
once to the temple, and knocked. There was no sound inside. He
knocked and knocked again; but still nobody came. At last he
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;90]</span>
pushed gently at the door, and was quite glad to find that it had not
been fastened. So he went in, and saw a lamp burning,&mdash;but no
priest.</p>

<p class="indent">He thought some priest would be sure to come very soon, and he
sat down and waited. Then he noticed that everything in the temple
was grey with dust, and thickly spun over with cobwebs. So he
thought to himself that the priests would certainly like to have an
acolyte, to keep the place clean. He wondered why they had allowed
everything to get so dusty. What most pleased him, however, were
some big white screens, good to paint cats upon. Though he was
tired, he looked at once for a writing-box, and found one, ground
some ink, and began to paint cats.</p>

<p class="indent">He painted a great many cats upon the screens; and then he
began to feel very, very sleepy. He was just on the point of lying
down to sleep beside one of the screens, when he suddenly remembered
the words: "Avoid large places;&mdash;keep to small."</p>

<p class="indent">The temple was very large; he was all alone; and as he thought
of these words&mdash;though he could not quite understand them&mdash;he
began to feel for the first time a little afraid; and he resolved to look
for a small place in which to sleep. He found a little cabinet, with a
sliding door, and went into it, and shut himself up. Then he lay down
and fell fast asleep.</p>

<p class="indent">Very late in the night he was awakened by a most terrible noise,&mdash;a
noise of fighting and screaming. It was so dreadful that he was
afraid even to look through a chink of the little cabinet: he lay very
still, holding his breath for fright.</p>

<p class="indent">The light that had been in the temple went out; but the awful
sounds continued, and became more awful, and all the temple shook.
After a long time silence came; but the boy was still afraid to move.
He did not move until the light of the morning sun shone into the
cabinet through the chinks of the little door.</p>

<p class="indent">Then he got out of his hiding-place very cautiously, and looked
about. The first thing he saw, lying dead in the middle of it, an
enormous monster rat,&mdash;a goblin-rat,&mdash;bigger than a cow!</p>

<p class="indent">But who or what could have killed it? There was no man or other
creature to be seen. Suddenly the boy observed that the mouths of
all the cats he had drawn the night before, were red and wet with
blood. Then he knew that the goblin had been killed by the cats
which he had drawn. And then, also, for the first time, he understood
why the wise old priest had said to him: "Avoid large places
at night;&mdash;keep to small."</p>

<p class="indent">Afterwards that boy became a very famous artist. Some of the cats
which he drew are still shown to travellers in Japan.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;91]</span>
At once upon reaching Japan (it is plain Hearn never
forgave me for compelling him to go) begin the complaints
of the downright hard work of writing, consequent upon
the loss of ideals. He breaks with publishers&mdash;an old-time
story; he is losing his inspiration, and his only hope
is that it will return to him again; in any Latin country
he could at once, he thinks, get back the much coveted
"thrill," or <i>frisson</i>. He would at last even relish the hated
United States. From the beginning he tires of the
Japanese character, and grows more and more tired the
longer he stays; it has no depth, this thin soul-stream; it
is incapable of long-sustained effort, prolonged study; he
cannot much longer endure Japanese officialism; and the
official "is something a good deal lower than a savage and
meaner than the straight-out Western rough." He would
wish never to write a line again about any Japanese
subjects. Things finally came to such a pass that the only
successful stimulus to work was that some one should do
or say something horribly mean to him, and the force of
the hurt could be measured in the months or years of
resultant labour. As none ever did a mean thing to him,
one may suspect that the psychology of his sudden
enmities towards others was that he must perforce <i>imagine</i>
that he had been "horribly" treated.</p>

<p class="indent">The old <i>Wanderlust</i>, never wholly absent, returns
strongly upon him; in less than a year he dreams of
leaving Japan and his wife, and of "wandering about
awhile;" he projects "a syndicate" whereby he may go to
Java (rather than Manila, where the Jesuits were), or, "a
French colony,&mdash;Tonkin, Noumea, or Pondicherry." A
tropical trip is planned for six months of every year. But
the "butterfly-lives" dependent upon him prevent, of
course. He always spoke of returning often. At the last
there is a savage growl that after thirteen years of work
for Japan, in which he had sacrificed everything for her, he
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;92]</span>
was "driven out of the service and practically banished from
the country."</p>

<p class="indent">Hearn's nostalgia for the nowhere or the anywhere was
only conquered by death. In 1898 the logic of his life, of
his misfortune, and character, begins to grow plainer, and
he "fears being blinded or maimed so as to prove of no
further use." It seems that if he had been able to do what
he tried so often, and longed so fervently to do, he would
have run away into the known or unknown, leaving children,
wife, and all the ties that bound him to any orderly life.
His vision had become almost useless; he had lost his
lectureship; more and more it grew impossible to coax or
force out of his mind such beautiful things as in younger
days; the Furies of his atheism, pessimism, and lovelessness
were close on his track; the hope of lectureships in
the United States had failed,&mdash;nothing was left, nothing
except one thing, which, chosen or not, came at the age of
fifty-four.</p>

<p class="indent">Lessing has said that "Raphael would have been the
great painter he was even if he had been born without
arms," and Burke has told of a poet "blind from birth
who nevertheless could describe visible objects with a
spirit and justness excelled by few men blessed with
sight." What irony of Fate it is that one almost blind
should teach us non-users of our eyes the wonder and
glory of colour; that the irreligious one should quicken
our faith in the immaterial and unseen; that a sensualist
should strengthen our trust in the supersensual; that one
whose body and life were unbeautiful should sing such
exquisite songs of silent beauty that our straining ears can
hardly catch the subtle and unearthly harmonies! For
Hearn is another of many splendid illustrations of the old
truth that a man's spirit may be more philosophic than his
philosophy, more scientific than his science, more religious
than his creed, more divine than his divinity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;94]</span></p>

<p class="cap">THAT Hearn was a true poet none will deny, but it
was one of the frequent seeming illogicalities of his
character that he had no love of metric or rhymed poetry.
I doubt if there is a single volume of such poetry in his
library, and I never heard him repeat a line or stanza, and
never knew him to read a page of what is called poetry.
I suspect the simple reason was that his necessities compelled
him rigidly to exclude everything from his world
of thought which did not offer materials for the remunerating
public. He had to make a living, and whence tomorrow's
income should come was always a vital concern.
Poetry of the metric and rhymed sort does not make
bread and butter; hence there was no time to consider
even the possibility of "cultivating the muses on a little
oatmeal."</p>

<p class="indent">Of poetry he once wrote:&mdash;"The mere ideas and melody
of a poem seem to me of small moment unless the complex
laws of versification be strictly obeyed." The dictum, considering
its source, is exquisitely ludicrous; for Hearn
poetry could not be coined into dollars, even if he had had
the mind and heart to learn anything of "the complex
laws of versification." Elsewhere he excused his manifest
utter ignorance of poetry and want of poetic appreciation
by saying that there is so little really good poetry that it
is easy to choose. He confessed his detestation of Wordsworth,
Shelley, and Keats, preferring Dobson, Watson, and
Lang. "Of Wordsworth&mdash;well, I should smile!" "Refined
poetry" he held of little or no value, but he found
the "vulgar" songs of coolies, fishermen, etc., very true
and beautiful poetry. He vainly tried to translate some of
Gautier's poems. He attempted original verse-making but
a few times, and from my scrap-book I reproduce one of
the results, kindly furnished me by Mr. Alexander Hill,
of Cincinnati, to whom it was given by Mr. Tunison.
Perhaps it was printed in <i>Forest and Stream</i>.</p>

cannot affect its value as a curiosity, and, in any case, its spirit is
thoroughly African. Unfortunately, without accented letters it is
impossible to convey any idea of the melody, the liquid softness, the
languor, of some of the couplets. My translation is a little free in

<p class="indent">I think there is some true poetry in these allusions to the snake. Is
not the serpent a symbol of grace? Is not the so-called "line of beauty"
serpentine? And is there not something of the serpent in the beauty
of all graceful women?&mdash;something of undulating shapeliness, something
of silent fascination?&mdash;something of Lilith and Lamia? The
French have a beautiful verb expressive of this idea, <i>serpenter</i>, "to
serpent"&mdash;to curve in changing undulations like a lithe snake. The
French artist speaks of the outlines of a beautiful human body as
"serpenting," curving and winding like a serpent. Do you not like
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;102]</span>
the word? I think it is so expressive of flowing lines of elegance&mdash;so
full of that mystery of grace which puzzled Solomon; "the way of a
serpent upon a rock."</p>

<p class="indent">The allusion to Voudooism in the last stanza especially interested
me, and I questioned the gentleman who furnished me with the song
as to the significance of the words: "I will make him turn into
a phantom." I had fancied that the term <i>fantome</i> might be interpreted
by "ghost," and that the whole line simply constituted a threat to
make some one "give up the ghost."</p>

<p class="indent">"It is not exactly that," replied my friend; "it is an allusion, I
believe, to the withering and wasting power of Voudoo poisons. There
are such poisons actually in use among the negro obi-men&mdash;poisons
which defy analysis, and, mysterious as the poisons of the Borgias,
slowly consume the victims like a taper. He wastes away as though
being dried up; he becomes almost mummified; he wanes like a
shadow; he turns into a phantom in the same sense that a phantom is
an unreal mockery of something real."</p>

<p class="indent">Thus I found an intelligent Louisianan zealous to confirm an
opinion to which I was permitted to give expression in the <i>Commercial</i>
nearly three years ago&mdash;that a knowledge of secret septic poisons
(probably of an animal character), which leave no trace discoverable
by the most skilful chemists, is actually possessed by certain beings
who are reverenced as sorcerers by the negroes of the West Indies
and the Southern States, but more especially of the West Indies,
where much of African fetichism has been transplanted.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX_THE_POET_OF" id="CHAPTER_IX_THE_POET_OF"></a>CHAPTER IX.&mdash;THE POET OF
MYOPIA</h2>

<hr class="hr2"/>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;104]</span></p>

<p class="cap">THE dependence not only of the literary character
and workmanship of a writer, but even his innermost
psyche, upon vision, normal or abnormal, is a truth
which has been dimly and falteringly felt by several
writers. Concerning "Madame Bovary," and his friend
Flaubert, Maxime du Camp reflects some glintings of the
truth. But these and others, lacking the requisite expert
definiteness of knowledge, have failed to catch the satisfying
and clear point of view. To illustrate I may quote the
paragraph of du Camp:</p>

<p class="indent">"The literary procedure of Flaubert threw everybody
off the track and even some of the experts. But it was a
very simple matter; it was by the accumulation and the
superposition of details that he arrived at power. It is the
physiologic method, the method of the myopes who look
at things one after the other, very exactly, and then
describe them successively. The literature of imagination
may be divided into two distinct schools, that of the
myopes and that of the hyperopes. The myopes see
minutely, study every line, finding each detail of importance
because everything appears to them in isolation;
about them is a sort of cloud in which is detached the
object in exaggerated proportions. They have, as it were,
a microscope in their eye which enlarges everything. The
description of Venice from the Campanile of St. Mark, that
of Destitution in 'Captain Fracasse,' by Gautier are the
capital results of myopic vision. The hyperopes, on the
other hand, look at the <i>ensemble</i>, in which the details are
lost, and form a kind of general harmony. The detail loses
all significance, except perhaps they seek to bring it into
relief as a work of art.... Besides, the myopes seek to
portray sensations, while the hyperopes especially aim at
analysis of the sentiments. If a hyperopic writer suddenly
becomes myopic, his manner of thinking, and consequently
of writing, at once is modified. What I call the school of
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;105]</span>
the myopes, Gautier names the school of the rabids. He
said to Mérimée: 'Your characters have no muscles,' and
Mérimée answered, 'Yours have no draperies.'"</p>

<p class="indent">But there is one consequence, common both to Flaubert
and to Hearn, a most strange unity of result flowing from
a seemingly opposed but really identical cause in the two
men. I have elsewhere set forth the reasons for my belief
that the secret of Flaubert's life, character, and literary art
consisted in an inability to think and write at the same
time. He was one of the most healthy and brilliant of
men when he did not read or write, but his mind refused
to act creatively whenever he wrote or read. From this
resulted his epilepsy. Fathered by the fear of this disease,
mothered by opium, and reared by unhygiene and eye-strain,
came the miserable "St. Anthony" of the second
remaking. In the failure of this pitiful work there was
naught left except bottomless pessimism, the "cadenced
phrase," and all the rest, called "Madame Bovary" and
"art for art's sake."</p>

<p class="indent">There never was a greater sufferer from eye-strain than
Flaubert, whose eyes were strikingly beautiful, and
seemingly of extraordinary perfection as optical instruments.
From this fact flowed the entire tragedy of the
man's life and of his life-work. His friend du Camp says
that had it not been for his disease he would have been,
not a writer of great talent, but a man of genius. Hearn
had the most defective eyesight, he was indeed nearly
blind; but physically he suffered little from this cause,&mdash;and
yet his choice of subjects and methods of literary
workmanship, and every line he wrote, were dictated and
ruled by his defect of vision. Opium, with the impossibility
of writing and creating at the same time, dominated
Flaubert's work and working, and the similar result was
begot by Hearn's enormous monocular myopia.</p>

<p class="indent">From Martinique, before I had met him, Hearn wrote me:
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;106]</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">I am very near-sighted, have lost one eye, which disfigures me
considerably; and my near-sightedness always prevented the gratification
of a natural <i>penchant</i> for physical exercise. I am a good
swimmer, that is all.</p>

<p class="indent">In reply to nearly all the questions about my near-sightedness I
might answer, "Yes." I had the best advice in London, and observe
all the rules you suggest. Glasses strain the eye too much&mdash;part of
retina is gone. The other eye was destroyed by a blow at college;
or, rather, by inflammation consequent upon the blow. I can tell you
more about myself when I see you, but the result will be more curious
than pleasing. Myopia is not aggravating.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">In "Shadowings," the chapter on "Nightmare-Touch,"
Hearn describes with his gift of the living word the dreams
and hauntings he endured when as a boy he was shut in
his room in the dark. It is a pitiful history, and shows
how a child may suffer atrociously from the combination
of an abnormally exuberant fancy and eye-strain, probably
with added ocular disease. The subjective sensations and
images were alive and Hearn's innate tendency to the
horrible and hideous gave them the most awful of nightmarish
realities.</p>

<p class="indent">I have already given (facing page 5) a copy of a little
photograph of Hearn at about the age of eight, standing by
Mrs. Brenane. It will be seen that the right eyeball was at
this time about as large and protruding as in later life. This
leaves a doubt whether the destruction of the left was due
to the blow at college at the age of sixteen. In one of my
letters he uses the word "scrofulous" in alluding to himself.</p>

<p class="indent">It was not only during the last years of his life, that, as
he says, "it was now largely a question of eyes." It was
always the most important of all questions; first, physically
and financially, because all hung upon his ability to write
many hours a day. How his little of visual power was
preserved under the work done is a marvel of physiology.
So unconscious was Hearn of the influence of eye-strain
in ruining the health of others (he himself had no eye-strain
in the ordinary meaning of the term) that he wonders
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;107]</span>
why the hard students about him were inexplainably dying,
going mad, getting sick, and giving up their studies. This
is hardly to be considered a fault of Hearn when educators
and physicians and oculists the world over, never suspect
the reason.</p>

<p class="indent">Moved by sympathy, and perhaps by the vaguest feeling
that to Hearn's poor vision were due, in part at least, both
his personal and literary characteristics, I early besought
him to make use of scientific optical helps in order to see
the world better, and to carry on his writing with greater
ease, and with less danger to the little vision left him. He
had but one eye, which was evidently enormously nearsighted.
The other had been lost in youth. I found that
he had about 25 diopters of myopia, to use the jargon of
the oculist, and that consequently he knew little about the
appearance of objects even a few feet away. In writing he
was compelled to place the paper or pen-point about three
inches from his eye. With the proper lens it was possible
to give him vision of distant objects about one-fourth as
clear as that of normal eyes. For a minute my disappointment
was equal to my surprise when I found that he did
not wish to see with even this wretched indistinctness, and
that he would not think of using spectacles or eyeglasses.
Later I found the reason for his action. He sometimes
carried a little lens or monocle in his pocket, which somewhat
bettered his vision, but in the several months he
spent with me I saw him use it only once or twice, and
then merely for an instant. I am almost sure that the
reason for this preference for a world almost unseen, or
seen only in colours, while form and outline were almost
unknown, was never conscious with Hearn, although his
mind was alert in detecting such psychologic solutions in
others. In studying his writings, this reason finally has
become clear to me.</p>

<p class="indent">When one chooses an artistic calling, Fate usually, and
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;108]</span>
to the artist unconsciously, dictates the kind of art-work
and the method of carrying it to realization. The blind
do not choose to be painters, but musicians; the deaf do
not think of music, though nothing prevents them from being
good painters. The dumb would hardly become orators
or singers, but they might easily be sculptors, or painters,
or designers. It is as evident that the poet is largely a
visualizer, if one may so designate this psychic function,
and without sight of the world of reality and beauty, poetry
will inevitably lack the charm of the real and the lovely.
Every great writer, in truth, shows more or less clearly that
the spring and secret of his imagination lie preponderantly
in the exceptional endowment, training, or sensitiveness of
one of the principal senses of sight, hearing, or touch. A
thousand quotations might be made from each of a dozen
great writers to prove the thesis. The man born blind,
however, cannot become a poet, because true poetry must
be conditioned upon things seen&mdash;"simple, sensuous, and
passionate" demands the great critic; but interwoven and
underrunning the simplicity, the passion, and the sense, is
and must be the world as mirrored by the eye. All thinking,
all intellectual activity, is by no means of the image and
the picture; all words are the product of the imagining, and
the very letters of the alphabet are conventionalized pictures.</p>

<p class="indent">Physiologically, or normally, the perfection of the artist
and of his workmanship thus depends upon the all-round
perfection of his senses, the fulness of the materials and of
his experience which these work on and in, and the logical
and æsthetic rightness of systematization. Conversely, a
new pathology of genius is coming into view which shows
the morbidizing of art and literature through disease,
chiefly of the sense-organs of the artist and literary workman,
but also by unnatural living, selfishness, sin, and the
rest. As Hearn was probably the most myopic literary
man that has existed, his own thoughts upon <i>The Artistic</i>
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;109]</span>
<i>Value of Myopia</i> are of peculiar interest. In 1887 one of
his editorials in the <i>Times-Democrat</i> runs as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">Probably more than one reader, on coming to page 15 of Philip
Gilbert Hamerton's delightful book, "Landscape," was startled by
the author's irrefutable statement that "the possession of very good
eyesight may be a hindrance to those feelings of sublimity that exalt
the poetic imagination." The fact is, that the impressiveness of
natural scenery depends a great deal upon the apparent predominance
of <i>mass</i> over <i>detail</i>, to borrow Mr. Hamerton's own words; the more
visible the details of a large object,&mdash;a mountain, a tower, a forest
wall, the less grand and impressive that object. The more apparently
uniform the mass, the larger it seems to loom; the vaguer a shadow-space,
the deeper it appears. An impression of weirdness,&mdash;such as
that obtainable in a Louisiana or Florida swamp-forest, or, much
more, in those primeval and impenetrable forest-deeps described so
powerfully by Humbolt,&mdash;is stronger in proportion to the spectator's
indifference to lesser detail. The real effect of the scene must be a
<i>general</i> one to be understood. In painting, the artist does not
attempt miscroscopic <i>minutiæ</i> in treating forest-forms; he simply
attempts to render the effect of the masses, with their characteristic
generalities of shadow and colour. It is for this reason the photograph
can never supplant the painting&mdash;not even when the art of
photographing natural colours shall have been discovered. Mr.
Hamerton cites the example of a mountain, which always seems more
imposing when wreathed in mists or half veiled by clouds, than when
cutting sharply against the horizon with a strong light upon it. Half
the secret of Doré's power as an illustrator was his exaggerated perception
of this fact,&mdash;his comprehension of the artistic witchcraft of
<i>suggestion</i>. And since the perception of details depends vastly upon
the quality of eyesight, a landscape necessarily suggests less to the
keen-sighted man than to the myope. The keener the view, the
less depth in the impression produced. There is no possibility of
mysterious attraction in wooded deeps or mountain recesses for the
eye that, like the eye of the hawk, pierces shadow and can note the
separate quiver of each leaf. Far-seeing persons can, to a certain
degree, comprehend this by recalling the impressions given in twilight by
certain unfamiliar, or by even familiar objects,&mdash;such as furniture and
clothing in a half-lighted room. The suggestiveness of form vanishes
immediately upon the making of a strong light. Again, attractive
objects viewed vaguely through a morning or evening haze, or at a
great distance, often totally lose artistic character when a telescope is
directed upon them.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;110]</span>
In the February number of <i>Harper's Magazine</i> we find a very
clever and amusing poem by the scholarly Andrew Lang upon this
very theme. The writer, after describing the christening-gifts of
various kindly fairies, tells us that the wicked one&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">

<span class="i2">&mdash;Said: "I shall be avenged on you.</span><br />

<span class="i0">Mine eyes, and wrought her wicked pleasure.</span><br />
<span class="i2">Well, of all the gifts the Fairies gave,</span><br />

<span class="i0">But I have visions of my own</span><br />
<span class="i2">And not for worlds would I undo them!</span>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">This is quite witty and quite consoling to myopes, even as a cynical
development of Philip Gilbert Hamerton's artistic philosophy. Still,
it does not follow that the myope necessarily possesses the poetic
faculty or feeling;&mdash;neither does it imply that the presbyope necessarily
lacks it. If among French writers, for example, Gautier was
notably nearsighted, Victor Hugo had an eye as keen as a bird's.
It is true that a knowledge of the effect of shortsightedness on the
imagination may be of benefit to a nearsighted man, who, possessing
artistic qualities, can learn to take all possible advantage of his
myopia,&mdash;to utilize his physical disability to a good purpose; but the
longsighted artist need not be at a loss to find equally powerful sources
of inspiration&mdash;he can seek them in morning mists, evening fogs, or
those wonderful hazes of summer afternoons, when the land sends up
all its vapours to the sun, like a smoke of gold. Beaudelaire, in his
<i>Curiosités Esthétiques</i>, made an attempt to prove that the greatest
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;111]</span>
schools of painting were evolved among hazy surroundings&mdash;Dutch
fogs, Venetian mists, and the vapours of Italian marsh-lands.</p>

<p class="indent">The evolutionary tendency would seem to indicate for future man a
keener vision than he at present possesses; and a finer perception of
colour&mdash;for while there may be certain small emotional advantages
connected with myopia, it is a serious hindrance in practical life.
What effect keener sight will have on the artistic powers of the future
man, can only be imagined&mdash;but an increasing tendency to realism in
art is certainly perceptible; and perhaps an interesting chapter could
be written upon the possible results to art of perfected optical instruments.
The subject also suggests another idea,&mdash;that the total inability
of a certain class of highly educated persons to feel interest in a
certain kind of art production may be partly accounted for by the
possession of such keen visual perception as necessarily suppresses the
sensation of breadth of effect, either in landscape or verbal description.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">Thus, according to Flaubert, the myope looks at things
one after another and describes details, while Hearn says
the exact opposite. Both are wrong. The oculist will feel
constrained to differ somewhat from Hearn in the foregoing
article.</p>

<p class="indent">In May 1887 he reviews editorially an article of my
own which I had sent him during the preceding year.
Again, because there has never been a literary artist with a
colour-sense so amazingly developed as that of Hearn, I
venture to copy his commendation of my views:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="center">COLOURS AND EMOTIONS</p>

<p class="center">(May 8, 1887)</p>

<p class="indent">The evolutionary history of the Colour-Sense, very prettily treated
of by Grant Allen and others, both in regard to the relation between
fertilization of flowers by insects, and in regard to the æsthetic pleasure
of man in contemplating certain colours, has also been considered in a
very thorough way by American thinkers. Perhaps the most entertaining
and instructive paper yet published on the subject was one in
the <i>American Journal of Ophthalmology</i> last September. It has just
been reprinted in pamphlet form, under the title of "The Human
Colour-Sense as the Organic Response to Natural Stimuli;" and contains
a remarkable amplification of these theories, rather suggested than
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;112]</span>
laid down by the author of "Physiological Æsthetics." Of course, the
reader whom the subject can interest, comprehends that outside of the
mind no such thing as colour exists; and that the phenomena of
colours, like those of sound, are simply the results of exterior impressions
upon nerve apparatus specially sensitive to vibrations&mdash;in the
one case of ether, in the other of air. Everybody, moreover,&mdash;even
those totally ignorant of the physiology of the eye&mdash;know that certain
colours are called primary or elementary. But it has probably occurred
to few to ask why,&mdash;except in regard to mixing of paints in a
drawing-school.</p>

<p class="indent">The theories of Gladstone and Magnus that the men of the Homeric
era were colour-blind, because of the absence from the Homeric poems
of certain words expressive of certain colours, have been disproved by
more thorough modern research. The primitive man's sense of colour,
or the sensitiveness of his retina to ether vibrations, may not have
been as fine as that of the Roman mosaic-worker who could select his
materials of 30,000 different tints, nor as that of Gobelin weavers, who
can recognize 28,000 different shades of wool. But the evidence goes
to show that the sense of colour is old as the gnawing of hunger or the
pangs of fear,&mdash;old as the experience that taught living creatures to
discern food and to flee from danger. There is, however, reason to
suppose, from certain developmental phenomena observed in the eyes
of children and newly-born animals, that the present condition of the
colour-sense has been gradually reached&mdash;not so much in any particular
species, as in all species possessing it,&mdash;just as vision itself must
have been gradually acquired. Also showy colours must have been
perceived before tints could be discerned; and even now we know
through the spectroscope, that the human eye is not yet developed to
the fullest possible perceptions of colour. Now the first colours
recognized by the first eyes must have presumably been just those we
call primary,&mdash;Yellow, Red, Green, Blue. Yellow, the colour of gold,
is also the colour of our sun; the brightest daylight has a more or less
faint tinge even at noon, according to the state of the atmosphere;&mdash;and
this tinge deepens at sunrise and sunset. Red is the colour of
blood,&mdash;a colour allied necessarily from time immemorial with violent
mental impressions, whether of war, or love, or the chase, or religious
sacrifice. Green itself is the colour of the world. Blue,&mdash;the blue of
the far away sky,&mdash;has necessarily always been for man the colour
mysterious and holy,&mdash;always associated with those high phenomena
of heaven which first inspired wonder and fear of the Unknown.
These colours were probably first known to intelligent life; and their
impressions are to-day the strongest. So violent, indeed, have they
become to our refined civilized sense, that in apparel or decoration
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;113]</span>
three of them, at least, are condemned when offered pure. Even the
armies of the world are abandoning red uniforms;&mdash;no refined people
wear flaming crimsons or scarlets or yellows;&mdash;nobody would paint a
house or decorate a wall with a solid sheet of strong primary colour.
Blue is still the least violent, the most agreeable to the artistic sense;
and in subdued form it holds a place, in costume and in art, refused to
less spiritual colours.</p>

<p class="indent">It might consequently be expected there should exist some correlation
between the primary colours and the stronger emotional states of
man. And such, indeed, proves to be the case. Emotionally the
colours come in the order of Red, Yellow, Green, Blue. Red still appeals
to the idea of Passion,&mdash;for which very reason its artistic use is being
more and more restrained. Very curious are the researches made by
Grant Allen showing the fact of the sensual use of the red. In Swinburne's
"Poems and Ballads "(the same suppressed work republished
in this country under its first title, "Laus Veneris"), the red epithets
appear 159 times, while gold, green and blue words occur respectively
143, 86 and 25 times. In Tennyson's beautiful poem, "The Princess,"
the red words occur only 20 times, the gold 28, the green 5, the blue
once. With all his exquisite sense of colour, Tennyson is sparing of
adjectives;&mdash;there is no false skin to his work; it is solid muscle and
bone.</p>

<p class="indent">Next to Red, the most emotional colour is Yellow&mdash;the colour of
life, and of what men seem to prize next to life,&mdash;Gold. We fancy we
can live without green sometimes; it comes third; but it is the hue
associated with all the labours of man on the earth, since he began to
labour. It is the colour of Industry. Blue has always been, since
man commenced to think, and always will be, until he shall have
ceased to think,&mdash;associated with his spiritual sense,&mdash;his idea of many
gods or of One,&mdash;his hopes of a second life, his faith, his good purposes,
his perception of duty. Still, all who pray, turn up their faces
toward the eternal azure. And with the modern expansion of the Idea
of God, as with the modern expansion of the Idea of the Universe, the
violet gulf of space ever seems more mystical,&mdash;its pure colour more
and more divine, and appeals to us as the colour of the Unknowable,&mdash;the
colour of the Holy of Holies.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">That Hearn wrote not from his own experience, out of
his own heart, and with its blood, was due to the fact that
life had denied him the needed experience; the personal
materials, those that would interest the imaginative or
imagining reader, did not exist. He must borrow, at first
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;114]</span>
literally, which for him meant translation or retelling. The
kind of things chosen was also dictated by the tragedy and
pathos of his entire past life. But as if this pitiful tangling
of the strands of Destiny were not enough, Fate added a
knot of still more controlling misfortune. His adult life was
passed without the poet's most necessary help of good vision.
Indeed he had such extremely poor vision that one might
say it was only the merest fraction of the normal. A most
hazy blur of colours was all he perceived of objects beyond
a foot or two away. There was left for him the memory
of a world of forms as seen in his childhood; but that fact
throws into relief the fact that it was a memory. It needs
little psychologic acumen to realize how inaccurate would
be our memories of trees, landscapes, mountains, oceans,
cities, and the rest, seen only thirty years ago. How unsatisfying,
how unreliable, especially for artistic purposes,
must such memories be! To be sure, these haunting and
dim recollections were, or might have been, helped out a
little by pictures and photographs studied at the distance
of three inches from the eye. The pathos of this, however,
is increased by the fact that Hearn cared nothing for such
photographs, etchings, engravings, etc. I never saw him
look at one with attention or interest. Paintings, water-colours,
etc., were as useless to him as the natural views
themselves.</p>

<p class="indent">Another way that he might have supplemented his
infirmity was by means of his monocle, but he made
little use of this poor device, because he instinctively
recognized that it aided so meagrely. One cannot be
sure how consciously he refused the help, or knew the
reasons for his refusal. At best it could give him only
a suggestion of the accurate knowledge which our eyes
give us of distant objects, and not even his sensitive mind
could know that it minimized the objects thus seen, and
almost turned them into a caricaturing microscopic smallness,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;115]</span>
like that produced when we look through the large
end of an opera-glass. What would we think of the world
if we carried before our eyes an opera-glass thus inverted?
Would not a second's such use be as foolish as continuous
use? There was an optical and sensible reason for his
refusal. With the subtle wisdom of the unconscious he
refused to see plainly, because his successful work, his
unique function, lay in the requickening of ancient sorrows,
and of lost, aimless and errant souls. He supplemented
the deficiencies of vision with a vivid imagination, a perfect
memory, and a perfection of touch which gave some sense
of solidity and content, and by hearing, that echo-like
emphasized unreality; but his world was essentially a
two-dimensional one. To add the <i>comble</i> to his ocular
misfortunes, he had but one eye, and therefore he had no
stereoscopic vision, and hence almost no perception of
solidity, thickness, or content except such as was gained
by the sense of touch, memory, judgment, etc. The little
glimpse of stereoscopic qualities was made impossible by
the fact of his enormous myopia, and further by the comparative
blindness to objects beyond a few inches or a few
feet away from the eye. The small ball becomes flat when
brought sufficiently near the eye. Practically the world
beyond a few feet was not a three-dimensional one; it was
coloured it is true, and bewilderingly so, but it was formless
and flat, without much thickness or solidity, and almost
without perspective.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> Moreover, Hearn's single eye was
divergent, and more of the world to his left side was
invisible to him than to other single-eyed persons. Most
noteworthy also is another fact,&mdash;the slowness of vision by
a highly myopic eye. It takes it longer to see what it
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;116]</span>
finally does see than in the case of other eyes. So all the
movements of such a myopic person must be slow and
careful, for he is in doubt about everything under foot, or
even within reach of the hands. Hearn's myopia produced
his manners.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_18_18" id="Footnote_18_18"></a>
<a href="#FNanchor_18_18">
<span class="label">[18]</span></a> I have gathered, but must omit, a hundred illuminating quotations
from Hearn's writings, illustrating the truth of the formlessness and
non-objectivity of his world, and how colour dominated his poorly seen
universe.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">Intellect, one must repeat, is largely, almost entirely, the
product of vision,&mdash;especially the æsthetic part of intellect.
And intellect, it should not be forgotten, is "desiccated
emotion"; which brings us up sharply before the question
of the effect upon æsthetic and general feeling, upon the
soft swirl and lift and flitting rush of the emotional nature,
in a psyche so sensitive and aerial as that of Hearn. In
this rare ether one loses the significance of words, and the
limitations of logic, but it may not be doubted that in the
large, the summarized effect of thirty years of two-dimensional
seeing and living, of a flat, formless, coloured world,
upon the immeasurably quick, sensitive plate of Hearn's
mind, was&mdash;well, it was what it was!</p>

<p class="indent">And who can describe that mind! Clearly and patently,
it was a mind without creative ability, spring, or the desire
for it. It was a mind improcreant by inheritance and by
education, by necessity and by training, by poverty internal
and external. To enable its master to live, it must write,
and, as was pitifully evident, if it could not write in obedience
to a creative instinct, it must do the next best thing.
This residual second was to describe the external world,
or at least so much of the externals of all worlds, physical,
biological, or social, as romance or common-sense demanded
to make the writing vivid, accurate, and bodied. Any good
literature, especially the poetic, must be based on reality,
must at least incidentally have its running obligato of
reality. For the poet, again emphasized, vision is the intermediary,
the broad, bright highway to facts. Prosaically,
local colour requires the local seer. Barred from this divine
roadway to and through the actual universe, the foiled mind
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;117]</span>
of Hearn could choose but one course: to regarment, transform,
and colour the world, devised and transmitted by
others, and reversing the old &#959; &#955;&#959;&#947;&#959;&#962; &#963;&#945;&#961;&#958; &#949;&#947;&#949;&#957;&#949;&#964;&#959; rewrite
the history of the soul as &#963;&#945;&#961;&#958; &#959; &#955;&#959;&#947;&#959;&#962; &#949;&#947;&#949;&#957;&#949;&#964;&#959;
, for in
Hearn's alembic the solidest of flesh was "melted" and
escaped in clouds of spirit; it was indeed often so disembodied
and freed that one is lost in wonder at the mere
vision of the cloudland so eerie, so silent, so void, so invisibly
far, and fading ever still farther away. But, chained
to the <i>here</i> Hearn could not march on the bright road.
He could never even see the road, or its ending. If freed
to go, <i>there</i> became <i>here</i> with the intolerable limitation of
his vision, the peculiarity of his unvision. The world, the
world of the <i>there</i> must be brought to him, and in the
bringing it became the <i>here</i>. In the process, distant
motion or action became dead, silent, and immobile being;
distance was transformed to presence, and an intimacy of
presence which at one blow destroyed scene, setting, and
illumination. For, except to passionate love, nearness and
touch are not poetical or transfiguring, and to Hearn love
never could come; at least it never did come. Except
in boyhood he never, with any accuracy of expression
or life, saw a human face; at the best, he saw faces
only in the frozen photographs, and these interested him
little.</p>

<p class="indent">With creative instinct or ability denied, with the poet's
craving for open-eyed knowing, and with the poet's
necessity of realizing the world out there, Hearn, baldly
stated, was forced to become the poet of myopia. His
groping mind was compelled to rest satisfied with the
world of distance and reality transported by the magic
carpet to the door of his imagination and fancy. There in
a flash it was melted to formless spirit, recombined to soul,
and given the semblance of a thin reincarnation, fashioned,
refashioned, coloured, recoloured. There, lo! that incomparable
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;118]</span>
wonder of art, the haunting, magical essence of
reality, the quivering, elusive protean ghost of the tragedy
of dead pain, the smile of a lost universe murmuring <i>non
dolet</i> while it dies struck by the hand of the beloved
murderer.</p>

<hr class="hr2"/>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;120]</span></p>

<p class="cap">"THE 'lovers of the antique loveliness,'" wrote Hearn,
"are proving to me the future possibilities of a long-cherished
dream&mdash;the English realization of a Latin style,
modelled upon foreign masters, and rendered even more
forcible by that element of <i>strength</i> which is the characteristic
of the northern tongues." "I think that Genius must
have greater attributes than mere creative power to be
called to the front rank,&mdash;the thing created must be beautiful;
it does not satisfy if the material be rich. I cannot
content myself with ores and rough jewels, etc." "It has
long been my aim to create something in English fiction
analogous to that warmth of colour and richness of imagery
hitherto peculiar to Latin literature. Being of a meridional
race myself, a Greek, I <i>feel</i> rather with the Latin race than
with the Anglo-Saxon; and trust that with time and study
I may be able to create something different from the
stone-grey and somewhat chilly style of latter-day English
or American romance." "The volume, 'Chinese Ghosts,'
is an attempt in the direction I hope to make triumph some
day, <i>poetical prose</i>." "A man's style, when fully developed,
is part of his personality. Mine is being shaped to a
particular end."</p>

<p class="indent">Hearn advised the use of the etymological dictionary in
order to secure "that subtle sense of words to which much
that <i>startles</i> in poetry and prose is due." But although
always remaining an artist in words, he, at his best, came
to know that artistic technique in ideas is a more certain
method of arousing and holding the readers' interest. He
also strongly urges a knowledge of Science as more
necessary to the formation of a strong style. In this, however,
he never practised what he commended, because he
had no mind for Science, nor knowledge of scientific
things. He spoke with pride of writing the scientific
editorials for his paper, but they were few and may quickly
be ignored.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;121]</span>
Flaubert was Hearn's literary deity; the technique of the
two men was identical, and consisted of infinite pains with
data, in phrase-building, sentence-making, and word-choosing.
With no writer was the filing of the line ever carried
to higher perfection than with both master and pupil;
fortunately the younger had to make his living by his pen,
and therefore he could not wreck himself upon the
impossible task as did Flaubert. For nothing is more
certain to ruin style and content, form as well as matter,
than to make style and form the first consideration of a
writer. Flaubert, the fashion-maker and supreme example
of this school, came at last to recognize this truth, and
wished that he might buy up and destroy all copies of
"Madame Bovary;" and he summed up the unattainableness
of the ideal, as well as the resultant abysmal pessimism,
when he said that "form is only an error of sense, and substance
a fancy of your thought." His ever-repeated "Art
has no morality," "The moment a thing is true it is good,"
"Style is an absolute method of seeing things," "The idea
exists only by virtue of its form," etc., led Flaubert and
his thousand imitators into the quagmire which Zola, Wilde,
Shaw, and decadent journalism generally so admirably
illustrate. That Hearn escaped from the bog is due to
several interesting reasons, the chief being his poverty,
which compelled him to write much, and his audience,
which, being Anglo-Saxon (and therefore properly and
thoroughly cursed), would not buy the elegant pornography
of Flaubert and the gentlemen who succeeded, or did not
succeed, in the perfection of the worship and of the works
of the master of them all. And then Hearn was himself at
least part Anglo-Saxon, so that he shrank from perfection
in the method.</p>

<p class="indent">There is a pathetic proof of the lesson doubly repeated in
the lives of both Flaubert and Hearn. "St. Anthony" was
rewritten three times, and each time the failures might be
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;122]</span>
called, great, greater, greatest. There lies before me
Hearn's manuscript translation of the third revision of the
work, in two large volumes, with a printed pamphlet of
directions to the printer, an Introduction, etc.,&mdash;a great
labour assuredly on Hearn's part. No publisher could be
found to give it to the world of English readers!<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> Moreover,
there was never in his life any personal happiness, romance,
poetry, or satisfaction which could serve as the material of
Hearn's æsthetic faculty. Almost every hour of that life
had been lived in physical or mental anguish, denied desire,
crushed yearnings, and unguided waywardness. Born of a
Greek mother, and a roving English father, his childhood
was passed in an absurd French school where another
might have become a dwarfed and potted Chinese tree.
Flung upon the alien world of the United States in youth,
without self-knowledge, experience, or self-guiding power,
he drank for years all the bitter poisons of poverty, banality,
and the rest, which may not shatter the moral and mental
health of strong and coarse natures. By nature and
necessity shy beyond belief, none may imagine the
poignant sufferings he endured, and how from it all he
writhed at last to manhood and self-consciousness, preserved
a weird yet real beauty of soul, a morbid yet
genuine artist-power, a child-like and childish, yet most
involuted and mysterious heart, a supple and subtle, yet
illogical and contentless intellect.</p>

<p class="indent">The most striking evidence of the pathetic and unmatched
endowment and experience is that, while circumstance
dictated that he should be a romancer, no facts
in his own life could be used as his material. There had
been no romance, no love, no happiness, no interesting personal
data, upon which he could draw to give his imagination
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;123]</span>
play, vividness, actuality, or even the semblance of reality.
So sombre and tragic, moreover, had been his own living
that the choice of his themes could only be of unhealthy,
almost unnatural, import and colouring. He therefore chose
to work over the imaginings of other writers, and perforce
of morbid ones.</p>

<p class="indent">A glance at his library confirms the opinion. When
Hearn left for Japan, he turned over to me several hundred
volumes which he had collected and did not wish to take
with him. His most-prized books he had had especially
rebound in dainty morocco covers, and these, particularly,
point to the already established taste, the yearning for the
strange, the weird, and the ghost-like, the gathered and
pressed exotic flowers of folklore, the banalities and
morbidities of writers with unleashed imaginations, the
love of antique religions and peoples, the mysteries
of mystics, the descriptions of savage life and rites&mdash;all
mixed with dictionaries, handbooks, systems of philosophy,
etc.</p>

<p class="indent">Under the conditioning factor of his taste, it is true that
his choice, or his <i>flair</i>, was unique and inerrant. He
tracked his game with fatal accuracy to its lair. His
literary sense was perfect, when he set it in action, and
this is his unique merit. There has never been a mind
more infallibly sure to find the best in all literatures, the
best of the kind he sought, and probably his translations
of the stories from the French are as perfect as can be.</p>

<p class="indent">His second published volume, the "Stray Leaves from
Strange Literature," epitomizes and reillumines this first
period of his literary workmanship. The material, the
basis, is not his own; it is drawn from the fatal Orient,
and tells of love, jealousy, hate, bitter and burning vengeance,
and death, sudden and awful. Over it is the
wondrous mystical glamour in which he, like his elder
brother Coleridge, was so expert in sunsetting these dead
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;124]</span>
days and deathless themes. His next book, "Some
Chinese Ghosts," was a reillustration of the same searching,
finding, and illuminating.</p>

<p class="indent">Flaubert's choice of subjects, as regards his essential
character, was of the most extreme illogicality; his
cadenced phrase and meticulous technique were also not
the product of his character or of his freedom. In the
Land of Nowhere, Hearn was likewise compelled to reside,
and it was necessarily a land of colour and echo, not one of
form. The suffering Frenchman emptied of inhabitants
or deimpersonalized his alien country, while the more
healthy Anglo-Saxon peopled it with ghosts. "Have you
ever experienced the historic shudder?" asked Flaubert.
"I seek to give your ghost a ghostly shudder," said Hearn.
Flaubert wrote:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">"The artist should be in his work, like God in creation,
invisible and all-powerful; he should be felt everywhere
and seen nowhere.</p>

<p class="indent">"Art should be raised above personal affections and
nervous susceptibilities. It is time to give it the perfection
of the physical sciences by means of pitiless method."</p>

<p class="indent">And Hearn's first and most beloved "Avatar," and his
most serious "St. Anthony"&mdash;works dealing with the
mysteries and awesomeness of disembodied souls and
ideals&mdash;"could not get themselves printed." Moreover, in
all that he afterwards published there are the haunting
far-away, the soft concealing smile, and the unearthly
memories of pain, the detached spirits of muted and transmuted
dead emotions, and denied yearnings, the formless
colourings of half-invisible and evanishing dreams.</p>

<p class="indent">For with Hearn's lack of creative ability, married to his
inexperience of happiness, he could but choose the darksome,
the tragical elements of life, the &#960;&#945;&#952;&#959;&#962; even of
religion, as his themes. His intellect being a reflecting, or
at least a recombining and colouring faculty, his datum
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;125]</span>
must be sought without, and it must be brought to him;
his joyless and even his tragic experience compelled him
to cull from the mingled sad and bright only the pathetic
or pessimistic subjects; his physical and optical imprisonment
forbade that objectivation and distinctive embodiment
which stamp an art work with the seal of reality, and
make it stand there wholly non-excusing, or else offering
itself as its own excuse for being. True art must have the
warp of materiality, interwoven with the woof of life, or
else the coloration and designs of the imagination cannot
avail to dower it with immortality.</p>

<p class="indent">Working within the sad limits his Fates had set, Hearn
performed wonders. None has made tragedy so soft and
gentle, none has rendered suffering more beautiful, none
has dissolved disappointment into such painless grief, none
has blunted the hurt of mortality with such a delightful
anæsthesia, and by none have death and hopelessness been
more deftly figured in the guise of a desirable Nirvâna.
The doing of this was almost a unique doing, the manner
of the &#960;&#959;&#953;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#962; was assuredly so, and constitutes Hearn's
claim to an artist's "For ever." He would have made no
claim, it is true, to this, or to any other endless existence,
but we who read would be too indiscriminating, would be
losers, ingrates, if we did not cherish the lovely gift he
brings to us so shyly. Restricted and confined as was his
garden, he grew in it exotic flowers of unearthly but
imperishable beauty. One will not find elsewhere an
equal craftsmanship in bringing into words and vision
the intangible, the far, fine, illusive fancy, the ghosts of
vanished hearts and hopes. Under his magic touch unseen
spirit almost reappears with the veiling of materiality, and
behind the grim and grinning death's-head a supplanting
smile of kindness invites pity, if not a friendly whisper.</p>

<p class="indent">As to literary aim, Hearn distinctly and repeatedly confessed
to me that his ideal was, in his own words, to give his
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;126]</span>
reader "a ghostly shudder," a sense of the closeness of the
unseen about us, as if eyes we saw not were watching us, as if
long-dead spirits and weird powers were haunting the very
air about our ears, were sitting hid in our heart of hearts.
It was a pleasing task to him to make us hear the moans
and croonings of disincarnate griefs and old pulseless
pains, begging piteously, but always softly, gently, for our
love and comforting. But it should not be unrecognized
that no allurement of his art can hide from view the deeper
pathos of a horrid and iron fatalism which to his mind
moved the worlds of nature or of life, throttled freedom,
steeled the heart, iced the emotions, and dictated the essential
automatism of our own being and of these sad dead millions
which crowd the dimly seen dreams of Hearn's mind.</p>

<p class="indent">It may be added that, accepting the command of his
destiny, Hearn consciously formed an ideal to which he
worked, and even laboured at the technique of its realization.
I have talked with him upon these and similar subjects for
many long hours, or got him to talk to me. The conversations
were usually at night, beneath trees, with the
moonlight shimmering through and giving that dim, mystic
light which is not light, so well suited to such a poet and
to his favourite subjects.</p>

<p class="indent">As to technique, there was never an artist more patient
and persistent than he to clothe his thought in its perfect
garment of words. Sometimes he would be able to write
with comparative ease a large number of sheets (of <i>yellow</i>
paper&mdash;he could write on no other) in a day. At other
times the words did not suit or fit, and he would rewrite a
few pages scores of times. Once I knew him to labour
over six lines an entire day, and then stop weary and unsatisfied.
I had to supply a large waste-basket and have
often wished I had kept for comparison and a lesson in
practical æsthetics the half-bushel or more of wasted sheets
thrown away nearly every day.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;127]</span>
Just as those outfitted with good eyes must find Hearn's
world too formless and too magnificently coloured, so
normal civilized persons will find it altogether too sexually
and sensually charged. Whenever able to do so he turns
a description to the ghostly, but even then <i>c'est toujours
femme!</i> A mountain is like a curved hip, a slender tree
takes the form of a young girl budding into womanhood,
etc. Colour, too, is everywhere, even where it is not,
seemingly, to our eyes, and even colour is often made
sensual and sexual by some strange suggestion or allusion.</p>

<p class="indent">Viewing merit as the due of conscious, honourable, unselfish,
and dutiful effort, Hearn's sole merit rises from his
heroic pursuit of an ideal of workmanship. Like glorious
bursts of illuminating sunshine through the fogs and clouds
of a murky atmosphere shine such sentences as these:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">What you want, and what we all want, who possess devotion to any
noble idea, who hide any artistic idol in a niche of our heart, is that
independence which gives us at least the time to worship the holiness
of beauty,&mdash;be it in harmonies of sound, of form, or of colour.</p>

<p class="indent">What you say about the disinclination to work for years upon a
theme for pure love's sake, without hope of reward, touches me,&mdash;because
I have felt that despair so long and so often. And yet I
believe that all the world's art-work&mdash;all that which is eternal&mdash;was
thus wrought. And I also believe that no work made perfect for the
pure love of art, can perish, save by strange and rare accident....</p>

<p class="indent">Yet the hardest of all sacrifices for the artist is this sacrifice to art,&mdash;this
trampling of self under foot! It is the supreme test for
admittance into the ranks of the eternal priests. It is the bitter and
fruitless sacrifice which the artist's soul is bound to make,&mdash;as in
certain antique cities maidens were compelled to give their virginity
to a god of stone! But without the sacrifice, can we hope for the grace
of Heaven?</p>

<p class="indent">What is the reward? The consciousness of inspiration only! I
think art gives a new faith. I think&mdash;all jesting aside&mdash;that could I
create something I felt to be sublime, I should feel also that the
Unknowable had selected me for a mouthpiece, for a medium of
utterance, in the holy cycling of its eternal purpose; and I should
know the pride of the prophet that had seen God face to face.</p>

<p class="indent">* * * * Never to abandon the pursuit of an artistic vocation
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;128]</span>
for any other occupation, however lucrative,&mdash;not even when she
remained apparently deaf and blind to her worshippers. So long as
one can live and pursue his natural vocation in art, it is a duty with
him never to abandon it if he believes that he has within him the
elements of final success. Every time he labours at aught that is not
of art, he robs the divinity of what belongs to her.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">And the greatest of our satisfactions with Hearn's personality
is that these were not mere words, but that he
consistently, resolutely, and persistently practised his
preaching. This was the only religion or ethics he had,
and praise God, he had it! That alone binds us to him in
any feeling of brotherhood, that only makes us grateful to
him.</p>

<p class="indent">Style has been too frequently and too long confounded
with content. There is the matter, the thing to be said,
the story to be told; and quite apart from this there is the
method of telling it, which, properly viewed, is style. So
long as the teller of the tale has only borrowed his message
or story from others, there cannot be raised much question
of originality, or discussion of the datum, except in so far
as pertains to the <i>choice</i> of material. And so long as the
stylist fingers etymological dictionaries for "startling words,"
so long will his style remain of the lower kind and etymologically
unstylish. When the technique becomes unconscious
and perfect, there is style, or the art, merged into
the content, and then, <i>le style c'est l'homme</i>, or, as Hearn
translated it, style becomes the artist's personality. In the
best Japanese works Hearn accomplished this, and with
his consummate choice of material there was the consummate
art-work. Subject, method, cunning handiwork,
psychologic analysis, generous and loyal sympathy, colour
(not form)&mdash;all were fused to a unity almost beyond disassociation,
and challenging admiration. But it is not
beyond our perfect enjoying.</p>

<p class="indent">It is true that Hearn has ignored, necessarily and wisely
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;129]</span>
ignored, the objective and material side of Japanese existence.
Mechanics, nationalism, economy, the materialism
of his material, had obviously to be untouched in his
interpretation, or in his "Interpretation." It would have
been absurd for him to have attempted any presentation
or valuable phasing of this important aspect. That for
him was in a double sense <i>ultra vires</i>. Such work will
not want for experts. But what Hearn has done was
almost wholly impossible to any other. His personal
heredity, history, and physiology, highly exceptional, seem
to have conspired to outfit him for this remarkable task.</p>

<p class="indent">There is still another reason, at first sight a contradicting
one, for both Hearn's fitness and his success in giving us a
literary incarnation of the spirit or soul of Japan in the
subjective sense: To his readers it must have appeared
an insoluble enigma why this superlatively subjective and
psychical "sensitive" should have been such an unrecking,
<i>outré</i>, and enthusiastic follower of Herbert Spencer's philosophy,
or that part of it given in the "First Principles."
It is told of an English wit that when asked if he was
willing to subscribe to the Thirty-nine Articles, he promptly
replied, "Oh, yes, forty of them if you wish." Hearn was
similarly minded&mdash;minus the fun,&mdash;and most unphilosophically
he went into utter captivity, seemingly, to the unphilosophic
philosopher. And yet the spirit of Spencer's
"First Principles" was in reality as different from that of
Hearn as was the spirit of St. Francis from that, for
instance, of Cecil Rhodes. The contradiction and ludicrousness
of this mismating is so easy of explanation that the
incongruity is missed. The forest is not seen because of
the trees. Hearn did not have true scientific instinct,
animus, or ability. Neither had Herbert Spencer&mdash;so far
as his "First Principles" is concerned, and as regards an
improved inductive method as shown in the "Psychology,"
"Biology," etc., Hearn, according to a letter, found he could
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;130]</span>
not interest himself enough to read one of these later works.
The clear and well-drilled scientific intellect admits that if
Spencer had not published his "First Principles," but had
gathered the facts of his later works before publishing an
epitomizing Last Principles, the matter would have been as
differently phased as night and day. Spencer cared infinitely
more for the systematization than he did for the
facts systematized. Reduced to its last analysis, the "First
Principles" was the reverse of a close induction from the
facts of nature and life. It presented the glitter of generalization
without the logic. The reverberating echoes of its
illogic, sweeping sonorously over the universe with an
indiscriminate ignoring of the world-wide difference between
matter and life, caught the fancy of the imprisoned poet
soul; he thoughtlessly yielded a homage which, from his
standpoint, was unjustified, and which objectively was an
unscrutinizing lip-service. Subjectively Spencerism gave
Hearn warrant for an inborn atheism and materialism
which had been heightened immoderately by the bitter
teachings of experience into a pessimism so horrid that
one shuddered when looking into the man's soul depths.
<i>Morne</i> was a favourite word with Hearn, and Spencer's
was a fateful philosophy for one whose birth and education
were desolation, and whose sight of the world was more
than <i>morne</i>, was the abomination of desolation, was in
truth the sheer awfulness of despair. Blindness were vastly
preferable to Hearn's affliction, but if that splendid poet
St. Francis had been so cursed, his face and his soul would
have been ecstatic with smiles, with joy, with faith, with
hope, and with love. So strange is the unaccountable
allotment of Fate in her endowments, gifts, and orderings.
There is and there can be no blame&mdash;only a pity wholly
beyond expression.</p>

<p class="indent">The aloofness, far-awayness, the inapproachable distance
and detachment of Hearn's spirit is one of the characteristics
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;131]</span>
felt in reading his best pages. Everything is infinitely
beyond our senses. To him everything was distant: the
near was far, the far was at infinity. He thus truly became
the poet of the <i>au delà</i>. His voice, itself an echo, comes to
us as from the hush of an eerie height above the beat and
wreck of the waves of our noisy shore. His personality as
revealed in his writings is an echo, a memory, almost the
memory of a memory, the thrill of the day-dream of a soul
retreating from sense.</p>

<blockquote>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Each day the quiet grew more still</span><br />
<span class="i0">Within his soul, more shrank the will</span><br />
<span class="i2">Beyond the jar of sense, serene,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Behind the hurt of world or ill,</span><br />
<span class="i2">Where sleep hushed silences unseen.</span><br />
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">He ever insists on a haunting glimpse of the pain and
the renunciation of others, of wasted and long-dead faces
and loves, always shrinking from our gaze, pallid in the
darkling light of the setting moon, of vanishing loves,
grievous story, forgotten myth, and ruined religion.</p>

<p class="indent">And yet, and yet, all that works to make Hearn immortal
in literature is, at last, not art <i>per se</i>. One might quote
freely showing that his "filing of the line," like that of
Flaubert, led to nothing, if the thought and feeling to be
put into the lines were not there. They were not there
with his masters, Flaubert, Gautier, Maupassant, and others,
and so these men will not inherit literary immortality.
They had no soul, and only the soul, the spirit, can be
immortalized. Hearn's good fortune is that unconsciously,
even almost against his will, he was more than they, more
than an artist as such. He had something else to do. If
it had not been for his poverty, the necessity to sell what
he wrote, he would surely have gone the same road to
Avernus as his masters. Then, too, he had no original
message to write, because he had no real soul, only a
borrowed one. Japan gave him her soul to rematerialize
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;132]</span>
and recolour with literary life. Without his Japanese work
Hearn would have died as <i>littérateur</i> in the year he died
as a physical body. To tell her "ghostly" stories was his
great office and function. When these were told his work
was done. His old gloating over the clotted villainies of
mediæval horror had been much outgrown, and it had no
chance to be used in Japan. The Japanese character would
not tolerate such things. The ghastly was transformed
into the ghostly, and his Oriental fancy was luckily turned
to better duties and pleasures. This more than Flaubert
was something not to be got from modern atheistic French
"Art for Art's sake," nor from modern Levantine nonentity
of character. How marvellous is his sympathy with his
subject, loyalty to his literary duty, and to his literary
ideal! His despised Irish father perhaps had slipped into
the otherwise invisible and limp threads of his Fates a little
mesh of spiritual reality, which, dormant, unrecognized,
and even scorned by him, came finally to give him all his
valour and worth. He could dower the insubstantial sigh
of a long dead soul or people with the wingéd word. It was
a word of colour, only,&mdash;and colour has no objective existence,&mdash;the
rainbow is not out there. And because it is
spiritual, not objective, the most beautiful, if the most
evanescent of all earthly things, is colour. The hearers of
soundless music, and the lovers of "the light that never
was on sea or shore" will understand what is meant. For
them Hearn really wrote: they are few, and scattered far,
but Hearn will magnificently multiply the number. His
amazing merit is that while without the great qualities
which make the greatest writers, he wrought such miracles
of winning grace and persuading beauty.</p>

<p class="indent">That he wrought against his will, and by the overcoming
of a seemingly cruel Fate, puts him almost outside of our
personal gratitude. We take the gift from a divinity he
did not recognize, one that used the rebellious hand and
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;133]</span>
the almost blind eye as a writing instrument. The lover
of the gruesome, the Spencerian scientist, the man himself,
must have wondered at the message when he came out
from under the influence of the pitiless inspiration.</p>

<p class="indent">One of Hearn's dangers was discursiveness, or want of
conciseness and intensity. "Chita" showed it, and the
West Indian work lost in value because of it. It is the
danger of all those writers who lack creative ability, and
who depend upon "local colour," and "style" for their
effect. The story's the thing, after all! In Hearn's
translations, and especially in "Stray Leaves," he for the
moment caught the view of the value of the content, saw
how the fact, dramatic, intense, and passionate is the all-desirable;
the art of its presentation is the art of letting it
flash forth upon the reader with few, apt, and flamelike
words, which reveal and not conceal the life and soul of
the act and of the actor. He tended to forget this. In
"Karma," besides, or rather by reason of, the moral,&mdash;his
newly got psyche,&mdash;he returned to a reliance upon essentials,
upon the datum of the spirit, and not upon its reflections,
refractions, and chromatics. The beautiful spectrum was
there refocused into white light, and the senses disappeared
to reveal behind them the divinity of soul. That art-lesson
was never forgotten by Hearn, and his Japanese work had a
purity and a reality, a white heat, which make his previous
stories and sketches seem pale and weak.</p>

<p class="indent">Questions of style and form sometimes run inevitably
into those of content and of logic. Essentially wanting
the rigorous training of form, without the content and
method of the scientific intellect, all Hearn's work shows
a lack of system, order, and subordination of parts. In
any single one of the Japanese volumes the absence of
logic is lamentably evident. He constantly repeats himself,
and the warp of some of his themes is worn threadbare.
His most ambitious work, "Japan," is, in truth, a
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;134]</span>
regathering and a restatement in more objective style, of
his previous imaginative studies. Almost the only added
thought concerns the difference between Shint&#333;ism and
ancestor-worship and the truism that Japan is to-day
ruthlessly sacrificing the life of the individual to that of
the nation. The lack of scholarship and of the scientific
animus (even in a field, folk-lore, more nearly his own than
any other) comes to view in his mistake of supposing
Spencer an authority on the subject of the origin of
religion, and in the blunder that assumed ancestor-worship
to be original in Japanese history and religion. Ancestor-worship,
according to Griffis, Knox, and other distinguished
authorities, was unknown to the ancient writers of Nippon
and was imported from China. How threadbare&mdash;and yet
how deftly, even charmingly concealed!&mdash;was the wearing
of his favourite themes, is shown by Hearn's fateful return
to the gruesome, especially in the later books, "Kott" and
"Kwaidan." These stories of the dead and of morbid
necrophilism are witnesses of Hearn's primitive interest in
the ghastly, impossible to be renounced or sloughed, not to
be replaced by desire for the supersensual, or by resolve
to transform the loathsome into the ghostly. Hearn
should never have been seduced into the delusion that he
could become the spokesman of any scientific animus,
methods or results. Erudition, logic, systematization, were
to him impossible. His function was another and of a
different nature, and his peculiar ability was for other
tasks. If we are adequately to appreciate the exquisiteness
of the earlier Japanese works, we will forget the "Japan,
an Interpretation."</p>

<p class="indent">If we look upon Hearn as a painter, almost the sole
colour of his palette was mummy brown, the powdered flesh
of the ancient dead holding in solution their griefs, their
hopes, their loves, their yearnings, which he found to sink
always to pulselessness, and to end in eternal defeat! But
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;135]</span>
the pallor and sadness for the brief moment of their
resuscitation was divinely softened and atoningly beautified.
Then they disappeared again in the waste and
gloom from which love and poesy had evoked them.</p>

<p class="indent">Felled in the struggle and defeat of the eternal battle
with death, the vegetation of untold ages long ago drifted
to an amorphous stratum of indistinguishable millionfold
corpses. Compression, deferred combustion and over-shrouding
transmuted and preserved it for a long-after-coming
time, for our warming, lighting, and delighting.
This has a perfect analogy in the history and use of tradition,
myth, folk-lore, custom, and religion, those symbolic
and concrete epitomes of man's long ancestral growths
and strivings, those true black diamonds of humanity's
experiences, its successes and failures, of its ideals and
disappointments. Hearn's artistry consisted in catching
up these gems, these extinguished souls washed from a
world of graves to the threshold of his miracle-working
imagination, and in making them flush for an instant with
the semblance of life. With what exquisite skill and grace
he was able to concentrate upon them the soft light-rays
of a fancy as subtle and beautifying as ever has been given
to mortal!</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI_SUMMARY_AND" id="CHAPTER_XI_SUMMARY_AND"></a>CHAPTER XI.&mdash;SUMMARY AND
CONCLUSION</h2>

<hr class="hr2"/>

<p class="cap"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;138]</span>
CONCERNING Hearn's outfitting of character by
his parents little or nothing is known. It is of
comparative unimportance because only a slight judicial
familiarity with his works, especially those of the pre-Japanese
periods, demonstrates that so far as concerns
substratum and substance of character he had neither.
There was an interior void, an absence of psychic reality,
which mocked his friends and which likewise baulked at
true creativeness. He never made a plot or blew the breath
of life into a character; his datum was always provided
from without and by another. He was a reflector only,&mdash;plus
a colourist&mdash;but a colourist of unrivalled excellence
and power. Form he knew not, had never seen, and that
is also his second conditioning weakness as an artist. Even
much of his philosophy was to justify the sensualism,
sensualisticism, pessimism, and godlessness which are early
manifest. But it was a product taken over from another,
a hastily devoured meal without mastication, digestion, or
assimilation. The interior emptiness was pathetically emphasized
by the fact of a contentless experience which also
worked to deprive his mind of spontaneous originality. He
never loved, except in one sorry way, never suffered much,
never lived much, for he was a hard worker, and he was
always seeking the ever-postponed, ever-unsatisfying Paradise,
so vainly hunted for, and which none ever finds except
in himself. <i>Ihm fehlt die Liebe,</i> was said of Heine,&mdash;how
much truer is it of Hearn! Conspiring with a native lack
of originality and want of normal experience, his enormous
near-sightedness made his choice of material and method
of handling it what we know. If anything was "inherited,"
it was a pseudo-Orientalism, a love of the monstrous and
gruesome, an astonishing indifference to Occidental history
and its conclusions as to sexual and social laws, a spontaneous
faith in faithlessness, a belief in irreligion, and an
almost hopeless trend toward fatalism and its inevitable
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;139]</span>
consequent, pessimism. Improvidence, financial as well as
moral, and disloyalty, to his friends as well as to his higher
nature, were his life-long, crippling, and condemning sins.
Two mysteries seem almost inexplainable. We know why
others had to give him his themes, and whence and how he
became a mirror, or an echo; and we understand how the
echoing became also wondrously, even exaggeratedly, but
beautifully, coloured. We can almost see why he was
foolishly and absurdly disloyal to personal friends, often
treating worst those who were the most kind to him; best,
those who were sometimes most cunningly selfish. We
may explain his ridiculous <i>Wanderlust</i>. But two attributes
are beyond all analysis:&mdash;one was a thing illogical with his
character, his cleaving to an ideal of literary workmanship
at the cost of selfishness, friendships, and temporary
success; and the other was his marvellous literary and
psychologic sympathy with whatever mind, people, circumstance,
story, or tradition, accident or choice brought
before the echoing or mirroring mind. If it were faint,
ghostly, and far away, he was a true thaumaturgist in loving
it into life, and living it into love.</p>

<p class="indent">This beautiful sympathy and literary loyalty made it
possible for Hearn to use the words of faith and of religion,
even of morality, as if they were his own, while with them
he had no personal sympathy whatever. For instance, he
could speak, as if from his heart out, of "a million astral
lamps lighted in the vast and violet dome of God's everlasting
mosque." He could praise as a sublime exhortation
the command, "O ye that are about to sleep, commend
your souls to Him who never sleeps!" It is, of course,
true that in Hearn's mind, doubtless, the poorest heathen
or savage virtue was sublimely virtuous, and any barbaric
vice had more of virtue in it than of viciousness. Surely
the most paltry Oriental excellence was far lovelier to him
than any Occidental heroism or beauty, however splendid.
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;140]</span>
We are thus helped to understand how his mind could
seem to flush with religious or ethical enthusiasm, while
the mosque of his real heart was only a chasm of gloomy
negation or a chaos of hideous death. This was due to the
fact that he had no constructive mind, and as only one
kind of doing, writing, was possible to him, because of his
near-sightedness, he must needs hate Occidentalism, and
exalt with a somewhat ludicrous praise the vapid, and even
pitiful childishness of semi-barbaric Orientalism. The
illogicality reaches its acme when Hearn, atheistic, disloyal,
and unethical, was compelled, as in some of his Japanese
pages, to put a morality and a religion behind the acts and
in the hearts of his characters, which with his and with their
atheism, was, dramatically, so out of place that the incongruity
would make us smile if it were not all done with
such a sweet and haunting grace. The culmination of the
contradictory trends is in "Karma." To put it bluntly,
Hearn had no spark of practical sexual virtue, and yet
praise one shall, marvel at one must, the literary and
dramatic honour which could, as in "Karma," so sympathetically
describe the almost unscalable summits of
virtue,&mdash;there where in holy silence, Passion gazes with awe
at her divine Master, Duty.</p>

<p class="indent">A negative condition of this sympathy was the interior
voidness of his character, the non-existence of reality
within him, which thus allowed the positive loyalty to his
subject free play; yet that which gave it leave to be, did
not explain the genesis or quality of life of the being. But
have a care! Do not ask the interest in any one subject
to last for more than a fleeting moment! Early and
always he possessed the rare, the wonderful gift of the
instant, the iridescent, the wingéd word. At last was
presented to him what he called a "soul," and that, in
conjunction with his growth in artistic technique, in his
handling of colours, and in procuring nobler data, helped
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;141]</span>
to give the Japanese work a content and an enduring
substance which distinguishes it from that of all others.
This atones for all the hurt that precedes, and it is a
benefaction and a delight to the entire world. In reward
Literature will place upon his head one of her loveliest
crowns.</p>

TAKEN as a whole, the criticisms upon Hearn's work
are complimentary. He has his warm admirers,
and some who are not so enthusiastic; but those who
criticize adversely do so with a gentleness,&mdash;I may say,
almost a reluctance that is perhaps the reflection of the
spirit of his work. And whatever else these may offer, all
agree that his writings have a unique charm.</p>

<p class="indent">Following are a few excerpts which should give an
average of opinions:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">"One great secret of his success in interpreting the
Japanese mind and temperament lay in his patience in
seeking out and studying minutely the little things of a
people said to be great in such. As Amenomori says of
Hearn's mind, it 'called forth life and poetry out of dust.'"
(327.)<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p class="indent">"As an interpreter of the Japanese heart, mind, hand
and soul, Mr. Hearn has no superior. But he will not
convert those who in health of body and mind love the
landmarks of the best faith of the race. It is very hard to
make fog and miasmatic exhalations, even when made
partly luminous with rhetoric, attractive to the intellect
that loves headlands and mountain-tops. The product of
despair can never compete in robust minds with the product
of faith." (357.)</p>

<p class="indent">"Sympathy and exquisiteness of touch are the characteristics
of Mr. Hearn's genius. He is a chameleon, glowing
with the hue of outer objects or of inward moods, or altogether
iridescent. He becomes translucent and veined
like a moth on a twig, or mottled as if with the protective
golden browns of fallen leaves. We may not look for
architectonic or even plastic powers. His is not the mind
which constructs of inner necessity, which weaves plots and
schemes, or thinks of its frame as it paints. He attempts
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;145]</span>
no epic of history. The delver for sociologic or theologic
spoil must seek deeper waters....</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">"In his later books the all-potent influence of Japanese
restraint seems to have refined and subdued his wonderful
style to more perfect harmonies....</p>

<p class="indent">"His chapters are long or short as are his moods. There
is little organic unity in them; no scientific aim or philosophic
grasp rounds them into form. Even his paragraphs
have little cohesion. Speaking of the forming of his sentences,
he himself has compared it to the focussing of an
image, each added word being like the turn of a delicate
screw." (306.)</p>

<p class="indent">"The secret of the charm that we feel to such a marked
degree in Mr. Lafcadio Hearn's volumes is that, in contrast
to other writers, he does take the Japanese very seriously
indeed." (316.)</p>

<p class="indent">"To the details of life and thought in Japan Mr. Hearn's
soul seems everywhere and at all times responsive. He
catches in his eye and on his pen minute motes scarcely
noticeable by the keen natives themselves." (367.)</p>

<p class="indent">"He has written nothing on Japan equal in length to
his tales of West Indian life. But while we deplore this
reserve of a writer who possesses every quality of style,
except humour, we have reason to be grateful for whatever
he gives us." (307.)</p>

<p class="indent">"The matchless prose and the sympathy of Mr. Hearn."
(324.)</p>

<p class="indent">"Mr. Hearn has the sympathetic temperament, the
minute mental vision, the subdued style peculiar to all that
is good in Japanese art and literature, needed for the accomplishment
of a labour which to him has been a labour
of love indeed. Here we have no mawkish sentimentality,
no excessive laudation, on the one hand; on the other, no
Occidental harshness, no Occidental ignorance of the sweet
mystery of Eastern ways of life and modes of thought.
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;146]</span>
What this most charming of writers on Far Eastern subjects
has seen all may see, but only those can understand
who are endowed with a like faculty of perception of
unobtrusive beauty, and a like power, it must be added,
of patient and prolonged study of common appearances
and everyday events." (295.)</p>

<p class="indent">"A man has just died, intelligent and generous, who had
succeeded in reconciling in his heart, the clear, rational
ideas of the West together with the obscure deep sense of
Extreme&mdash;Asia: Lafcadio Hearn. In the hospitality of
his recipient soul, high European civilization and high
Japanese civilization found a meeting-place; harmonized;
completed, one in the other....</p>

<p class="indent">"In English-speaking countries, especially in the United
States, Lafcadio Hearn already enjoys a just reputation.
The lovers of the exotic, esteem him as equal to Kipling
or Stevenson. In France, the <i>Revue de Paris</i> has begun
to make him known, by publishing some of his best articles,
elegantly and faithfully translated. His budding fame is
destined to increase, as Europe takes a greater interest in
the arts and the thoughts of the Extreme-Orient. His
prose, exact and harmonious, will be admired as one of the
finest since Ruskin wrote: his very personal style, at the
same time subtle and powerful, will be noted: he will be
especially admired for his delicate and profound intelligence
of that Japanese civilization which, to us, remains
so mysterious. What characterizes the talent of Lafcadio
Hearn, that which gives it its precious originality,
is the rare mixture of scientific precision and idealistic
enthusiasm: his work might justly be entitled Truth
and Poesy: 'In reading these essays,' says one of our
best existing Japanese scholars, Professor Chamberlain,
'one feels the truth of Richard Wagner's statement:
"<i>Alles verständniss kommt uns nur durch die Liebe.</i>" (All
understanding comes to us only through Love.) If Lafcadio
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;147]</span>
Hearn understands Japan best, and makes it better
understood than any other writer, it is because he loves it
best.'</p>

<p class="indent">"Lafcadio Hearn describes with intelligence, with love
all aspects of Japanese life: Nature and inhabitants; landscapes,
animals and flowers; material life and life moral;
classic Art and popular literature; philosophies, religions
and superstitions. He awakens in us an exquisite feeling
of old aristocratic and feudal Japan: he explains to us the
prodigious revolution that modern Japan has created in
thirty years....</p>

<p class="indent">"Hearn has consecrated to the study of Japanese art
some of his most curious psychological analyses.</p>

<p class="indent">"Lafcadio Hearn takes a deep interest in the religious
life of the Japanese. He studies with the minutest exactness
the ancient customs of Shint&#333;ism, high moral precepts
of Buddhism, and also the popular superstitions that hold
on, for instance, to the worship of foxes, and to the idea of
pre-existence." (393.)</p>

<p class="indent">"To a certain large class of his adopted countrymen, his
hatred of Christianity, which was pronounced long before
he went to Japan, and his fondness for Oriental cults of all
kinds, was recommendation. But it is still an open question
whether he did harm or good to the Japanese by his
advocacy of their superstitions....</p>

<p class="indent">"Hearn's books are little known to the multitude. But
they are familiar to an influential class the world over. In
him Japan has lost a powerful and flattering advocate,
and the English world one of its masters in style." (332.)</p>

<p class="indent">"Mr. Hearn was not a philosopher or a judicial student
of life. He was a gifted, born impressionist, with a style
resembling that of the French Pierre Loti. His stories
and descriptions are delicate or gorgeous word pictures
of the subtler and more elusive qualities of Oriental life."
(293.)</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;148]</span>
"His art is the power of suggestion through perfect
restraint.... He stands and proclaims his mysteries at
the meeting of three ways. To the religious instinct of
India,&mdash;Buddhism in particular,&mdash;which history has engrafted
on the æsthetic sense of Japan, Mr. Hearn brings
the interpreting spirit of Occidental science; and these
three traditions are fused by the peculiar sympathies of his
mind into one rich and novel compound.... In these
essays and tales, whose substance is so strangely mingled
together out of the austere dreams of India and the subtle
beauty of Japan and the relentless science of Europe, I
read vaguely of many things which hitherto were quite
dark." (308.)</p>

<p class="indent">"He brings to the study of all aspects of Japanese
life, intelligence, and love; he also sets sail in his descriptions
and analyses towards a general theory on life; he
is a Japanizing psychologist: he is also a philosopher....</p>

<p class="indent">"At all events, Lafcadio Hearn has the merit of recalling
powerfully to the Europeans of Europe the importance,
often misunderstood, of Eastern civilization. No one
better than this Japanizing enthusiast to make us feel what
there is of narrowness in our habitual conception of the
world, in our individualistic literature, misunderstanding
too much the influence of the Past in our anthropocentric
art, neglecting Nature too often, penetrated too 'singly'
in our classic philosophy with Greco-Latin and Christian
influences. 'Till now,' says Lafcadio Hearn very forcibly,
'having lived only in one hemisphere, we have thought but
half thoughts.' We should enlarge our hearts and our
minds by taking into our circle of culture, all the art and all
the thought of the extreme East.</p>

<p class="indent">"From the philosophical view-point, Lafcadio Hearn has
the merit of calling attention to the high value of Shint&#333;ism,
and above all of Buddhism. His work deserves to exercise
an influence on the religious ideas of the West. If religion
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;149]</span>
can no longer occupy any place in the intellectual life
of humanity, more and more invaded by science, she can
subsist a long time yet, perhaps always, in her sentimental
life." (392.)</p>

<p class="indent">"For that rôle [as interpreter of Japan] he was eminently
unfitted both by temperament and training. Indeed he was
not slow to recognize his lack of the judicial faculty, and on
one occasion acknowledged that he is a 'creature of
extremes.' ... But Hearn often succeeds in reaching
the heart of things by his faculty of sympathy, in virtue of
which alone his books deserve perusal; when he fails it is
because of a lack of the unimpassioned judicial faculty, a
tendency to subordinate reason to feeling, an inclination to
place sympathy in the position of judge rather than guide."
(359.)</p>

<p class="indent">"Lafcadio Hearn not only buried himself in the Japanese
world, but gave his ashes to the soil so often devastated by
earthquake, typhoon, tidal wave and famine, but ever
fertile in blooms of fancy which lies under the River
of Heaven. The air of Nippon, poor in ozone, is overpopulated
by goblins. No writer has ever excelled this
child of Greece and Ireland in interpreting the weird fancies
of peasant and poet in the land of bamboo and cherry
flowers.... Hearn's life seemed crushed under 'the horror
of infinite Possibility.' Hence perhaps the weird fascination
of his work and style." (348.)</p>

<p class="center">EPITOMES</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Avatar</span> (281).&mdash;It was during the Cincinnati period
that Hearn made this&mdash;his first translation from the French.
Writing of it in 1886, he says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">I have a project on foot&mdash;to issue a series of translations of archæological
and artistic French romance&mdash;Flaubert's "Tentation de Saint-Antoine";
De Nerval's "Voyage en Orient"; Gautier's "Avatar";
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;150]</span>
Loti's most extraordinary African and Polynesian novels; and Beaudelaire's
"Petits Poemes en Prose."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But three years later, he writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">The work of Gautier cited by you&mdash;"Avatar"&mdash;was my first translation
from the French. I never could find a publisher for it, however,
and threw the MS. away at last in disgust. It is certainly a wonderful
story; but the self-styled Anglo-Saxon has so much&mdash;prudery that
even this innocent phantasy seems to shock his sense of the
"proper."</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">La Tentation de Saint-Antoine</span> (282) was probably
translated at about the same time. Hearn failed to
find a publisher who would take it, but the manuscript is
still in my possession. Hearn's own complete <i>scenario</i>,
together with a description of the manuscript, is given
on another page. I quote from Hearn about this work:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">The original is certainly one of the most exotically strange pieces of
writing in any language, and weird beyond description.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of his own translation, he writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">The work is audacious in parts; but I think nothing ought to be
suppressed. That serpent-scene, the crucified lions, the breaking of
the chair of gold, the hideous battles about Carthage,&mdash;these pages
contain pictures that ought not to remain entombed in a foreign
museum.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">The winter of 1877, the year Hearn arrived in New
Orleans, he corresponded with the Cincinnati <i>Commercial</i>
under the name of "Ozias Midwinter" (219). Excerpts
from this series of letters are given in the chapter, "The
New Orleans Period."</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">One of Cleopatra's Nights</span> (20) was the first book
to be published. The translations were made during the
latter part of the Cincinnati period, but the volume did not
appear until some years later, while Hearn was in New
Orleans. It was prepared at the hour when his craving for
the exotic and weird was at its height. From the opening
word to the last the six stories are one long Dionysian
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;151]</span>
revel of an Arabian Night's Dream, and within their pages
it is not difficult to feel that "one is truly dead only when
one is no longer loved." What an exotic group of names it
is:&mdash;Cleopatra, "she that made the whole world's bale and
bliss;" Clarimonde,</p>

<p class="margin-left16">"Who was famed in her lifetime<br />
As the fairest of women;"</p>

<p class="indent">Arria Marcella; the Princess Hermonthis; Omphale; and
the one "fairer than all daughters of men, lovelier than all
fantasies realized in stone"&mdash;Nyssia. It is a tapestry
woven of the lights and jewels and passion of an antique
world. "You will find in Gautier," Hearn writes, "a perfection
of melody, a warmth of word colouring, a voluptuous
delicacy;" "Gautier could create mosaics of word jewellery
without equals." Hearn's "pet stories" are "Clarimonde"
and "Arria Marcella." Is it strange that he should delight
in these beautiful vampires?</p>

<p class="indent">In this work, and in the tales to follow, we already
perceive that colour is to become a sort of a fetich to be
worshipped. Here in the studio of another artist, he serves
his first apprenticeship, and from the highly toned palette
of Gautier he learns how to mix and lay on the colours that
he himself is later to use so richly.</p>

<p class="indent">In speaking of this book, a critic says:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">"His learning and his inspiration were wholly French in
these productions, as also in what was his first and in some
ways his best book, "One of Cleopatra's Nights," and other
tales translated from Théophile Gautier. While Hearn was
faithful to his original, he also improved upon it, and many
a scholar who knows both French and English has confessed
under the rose that Gautier is outdone." (332.)</p>

<p class="indent">Of his work, Hearn writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">You asked me about Gautier. I have read and possess nearly all
his works; and before I was really mature enough for such an undertaking
I translated his six most remarkable short stories. The work
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;152]</span>
contains, I regret to say, several shocking errors, and the publishers
refused me the right to correct the plates. The book remains one of
the sins of my literary youth, but I am sure my judgment of the value
of the stories was correct.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">While preparing his next book, Hearn published in the
<i>Century</i>, "The Scenes of Cable's Romances" (220). In
this article he vivifies the quarters and dwellings that Mr.
Cable in his delightful stories had already made famous.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">The First Muezzin, Bilâl</span> (405), was written in the
fall of 1883, during the New Orleans period. It is a
beautiful, serious piece of work, and is written with the
fine, sonorous quality that such a theme should inspire.
That it was a labour of love is shown in Hearn's letters
written at its inception to Mr. Krehbiel, who was an
invaluable aid to him in compiling its musical part.
"Bilâl" was probably published finally in the <i>Times-Democrat</i>,
after being refused by <i>Harper's</i>, the <i>Century</i>,
and some others.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">The traveller slumbering for the first time within the walls of an
Oriental city, and in the vicinity of a minaret, can scarcely fail to be
impressed by the solemn beauty of the Mohammedan Call to Prayer.
If he have worthily prepared himself, by the study of book and of
languages, for the experiences of Eastern travel, he will probably have
learned by heart the words of the sacred summons, and will recognize
their syllables in the sonorous chant of the Muezzin,&mdash;while the rose-coloured
light of an Egyptian or Syrian dawn expands its flush to the
stars. Four times more will he hear that voice ere morning again
illuminates the east:&mdash;under the white blaze of noon; at the sunset
hour, when the west is fervid with incandescent gold and vermilion;
in the long after-glow of orange and emerald fires; and, still later,
when a million astral lamps have been lighted in the vast and violet
dome of God's everlasting mosque.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In four parts Hearn tells the history of Bilâl, who</p>

<blockquote>
<p>was an African black, an Abyssinian,&mdash;famed for his fortitude as a confessor,
for his zeal in the faith of the Prophet, and for the marvellous
melody of his voice, whose echoes have been caught up and prolonged
and multiplied by all the muezzins of Islam, through the passing of
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;153]</span>
more than twelve hundred years.... And the words chanted by all
the muezzins of the Moslem world,&mdash;whether from the barbaric brick
structures which rise above "The Tunis of the Desert," or from the
fairy minarets of the exquisite mosque at Agra,&mdash;are the words first
sung by the mighty voice of Bilâl.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">Bilâl was the son of an Abyssinian slave-girl, and himself
began life as a slave. The first preaching of Mahomet
had deep effect upon the slaves of Mecca, and Bilâl was
perhaps the earliest of these to become a convert. Even
under the tortures of the persecutors, he could not be
made to apostatize&mdash;always he would answer, "<i>Ahad!
Ahad</i>:" "<i>One</i>, one only God!" Abu Bekr, the bosom
friend of the great Prophet, observing Bilâl, bought him,
and set him free. Then Bilâl became the devoted servant
of Mahomet; and, in fulfilment of a dream, he was made
the First Muezzin to sound the <i>Adzân</i>, the Call to
Prayer.</p>

<blockquote>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">God is Great!</span><br />
<span class="i4">God is Great!</span><br />
<span class="i0">I bear witness there is no other God but God!</span><br />
<span class="i0">I bear witness that Mahomet is the Prophet of God!</span><br />
<span class="i2">Come unto Prayer!</span><br />
<span class="i2">Come unto Salvation!</span><br />
<span class="i4">God is Great!</span><br />
<span class="i2">There is no other God but God!</span>
</div>
</div>

<hr />

<p class="indent">After the death of Mahomet, Bilâl ceased to sing the <i>Adzân</i>:&mdash;the
voice that had summoned the Prophet of God to the house of prayer
ought not, he piously fancied, to be heard after the departure of his
master. Yet, in his Syrian home, how often must he have prayed to
chant the words as he first chanted them from the starlit housetop in
the Holy City, and how often compelled to deny the petitions of those
who revered him as a saint and would perhaps have sacrificed all
their goods to have heard him but once lift up his voice in musical
prayer!... But when Omar visited Damascus the chiefs of the people
besought him that, as Commander of the Faithful, he should ask Bilâl
to sing the Call in honour of the event; and the old man consented to
do so for the last time....<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;154]</span></p>

<p class="indent">To hear Bilâl must have seemed to many as sacred a privilege as
to have heard the voice of the Prophet himself,&mdash;the proudest episode
of a lifetime,&mdash;the one incident of all others to be related in long afteryears
to children and to grandchildren. Some there may have been
whom the occasion inspired with feelings no loftier than curiosity;
but the large majority of those who thronged to listen in silent
expectancy for the <i>Allah-hu-akbar!</i> must have experienced emotions
too deep to be ever forgotten. The records of the event, at least,
fully justify this belief;&mdash;for when, after moments of tremulous waiting,
the grand voice of the aged African rolled out amid the hush,&mdash;with
the old beloved words,&mdash;the old familiar tones, still deep and clean,&mdash;Omar
and all those about him wept aloud, and tears streamed down
every warrior-face, and the last long notes of the chant were lost in a
tempest of sobbing.</p>

whom Aki caught in his own fish-net, and whom he grew
to love more than his own life.</p>

<p class="indent">The story lingers of the sea-bird which fell into the
hunter's hand, and when he looked more closely he found
it had become transformed into a beautiful girl, "slender
... like a young moon," and pity rose in the hunter's
heart, and then love. One day, when their children had
become strong and swift, and while they were all hunting
together, the Bird-Wife called to the little ones to gather
feathers: then she covered their arms and her own shoulders
with the feathers, and far away they flew.</p>

<p class="indent">Passing onward, we read of Tilottama, and that by
reason of her beauty "the great gods once became multiple-faced
and myriad-eyed"; and that this beauty brought
punishment to the wicked Sounda and Oupasounda.</p>

<p class="indent">There is Bakawali, for "whose history of love, human
and superhuman, a parallel may not be found." For her
great love of the mortal youth Taj-ulmuluk each night she
sacrificed herself to the fiercest purification of fire. And
then to appease the gods, she suffered herself to be turned
for ten long years into marble from her waist to her feet.
Her lover ministered to her and watched by her side
through the terrible years until she was reincarnated for
him.</p>

<p class="indent">Then we see the statue of Natalika, who avenged the
death of her people.</p>

<p class="indent">And who shall answer the riddle of the Corpse Demon?
And which one may not profit by the wisdom of the youth
who knew nothing of science? Perhaps our hearts stir
with a soft regret for the atonement of Pundari. And so
we wander through a maze of colour and of magic, tarrying
to listen to the voice of Kalewala, for&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;156]</span>
As he sang the fair Sun paused in her course to hear him; the
golden Moon stopped in her path to listen; the awful billows of the
sea stood still; the icy rivers that devour the pines, that swallow up
the firs, ceased to rage; the mighty cataracts hung motionless above
their abysses; the waves of Juortana lifted high their heads to hear.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">"Slender she was as the tulip upon its stalk, and in
walking her feet seemed kisses pressed upon the ground.
But hadst thou beheld her face unveiled, and the whiteness
of her teeth between her brown lips when she smiled!"
Alas, she was a good Christian maiden and he a good
Mussulman, and so in this Legend of Love each loyal
heart dies pronouncing the faith of the other, lest they
should not meet at the Day of Judgment.</p>

<p class="indent">As we draw near the last figures on the tapestry, we find
those two tender pictures of which Hearn himself speaks:
"Your preference for Boutimar pleases me: Boutimar was
my pet. There is a little Jewish legend in the collection&mdash;Esther&mdash;somewhat
resembling it in pathos." These stories
afford a glimpse into that gentle heart, which was later
to respond to the exquisite faiths and loyalties of the
Japanese.</p>

<p class="indent">Now the Creator sent unto Solomon a cup which contained
some of the waters of youth and of life without end.
And Solomon was asked: "Wilt thou drink hereof and live
divinely immortal through ages everlasting, or wilt thou
rather remain within the prison of humanity?" And
Solomon dreamed upon these words; and he assembled in
council a representative of all those over whom he held
dominion. Then Solomon asked Boutimar, the wild dove,
most loving of all living creatures, whether he should drink
of the magic waters, and thus learn the bliss of earthly
immortality. When Boutimar, the wild dove, learned that
the cup held only enough water for one person, he made
answer in the language of birds:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">"O prophet of God! how couldst thou desire to be living alone,
when each of thy friends and of thy counsellors and of thy children
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;157]</span>
and of thy servants and of all who loved thee were counted with the
dead? For all of these must surely drink the bitter waters of death,
though thou shouldst drink the Water of Life. Wherefore desire
everlasting youth, when the face of the world itself shall be wrinkled
with age, and the eyes of the stars shall be closed by the black fingers
of Azrael? When the love thou hast sung of shall have passed away
like a smoke of frankincense, when the dust of the heart that beat
against thine own shall have long been scattered by the four winds of
heaven, when the eyes that looked for thy coming shall have become
a memory, when the voices grateful to thine ear shall have been
eternally stilled, when thy life shall be one oasis in a universal waste
of death, and thine eternal existence but a recognition of eternal
absence,&mdash;wilt thou indeed care to live, though the wild dove perish
when its mate cometh not?"</p>

<p class="indent">And Solomon, without reply, silently put out his arm and gave back
the cup.... But upon the prophet-king's rich beard, besprinkled
with powder of gold, there appeared another glitter as of clear dew,&mdash;the
diamond dew of the heart, which is tears.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">Esther, whose comeliness surpassed even that of Sarah,
and her rich husband had lived together ten years, but
there was no happiness in the soul of the good man, for
"the sound of a child's voice had never made sunshine
within his heart." So Esther and her husband sorrowed
bitterly. And they brought the burden of their grief to
Rabbi Simon ben Yochai, and when they had told him, a
silence as of the Shechinah came upon the three, only the
eyes of the Rabbi seemed to smile. And it was agreed
that the twain should part; thus the Israelite could be
known as a father in Israel.</p>

<p class="indent">A feast then was laid at the house, and before all the
guests her husband spoke lovingly to Esther, and in token
of his affection and his grief bade her to take from the
house "whatever thou desirest, whether it be gold or jewels
beyond price." And the wine was passed, and the people
made merry, and finally a deep sleep fell upon them all.
Then Esther gave command that her husband sleeping
should be carried to her father's house. In the morning
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;158]</span>
her husband awakened, and confused he cried out, "Woman,
what hast thou done?"</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">Then, sweeter than the voice of doves among the fig-trees, came the
voice of Esther: "Didst thou not bid me, husband, that I should
choose and take away from thy house whatsoever I most desired?
And I have chosen thee, and have brought thee hither, to my father's
home ... loving thee more than all else in the world. Wilt thou
drive me from thee now?" And he could not see her face for tears of
love; yet he heard her voice speaking on,&mdash;speaking the golden words
of Ruth, which are so old yet so young to the hearts of all that love:
"Whithersoever thou shalt go, I will also go; and whithersoever thou
shalt dwell, I also will dwell. And the Angel of Death only may part
us; for thou art all in all to me." ...</p>

<p class="indent">And in the golden sunlight at the doorway suddenly stood, like a
statue of Babylonian silver, the grand grey figure of Rabbi Simon ben
Yochai, lifting his hands in benediction.</p>

<p class="indent">"<i>Schmah Israel!</i>&mdash;the Lord our God, who is One, bless ye with
everlasting benediction! May your hearts be welded by love, as gold
with gold by the cunning of goldsmiths! May the Lord, who coupleth
and setteth thee single in families, watch over ye! The Lord make
this valiant woman even as Rachel and as Lia, who built up the house
of Israel! And ye shall behold your children and your children's
children in the House of the Lord!"</p>

<p class="indent">Even so the Lord blessed them; and Esther became as the fruitful
vine, and they saw their children's children in Israel. Forasmuch as
it is written: "He will regard the prayer of the destitute."</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Gombo Zhèbes</span><a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>(2) followed in the New Orleans period.
It is a compilation of 352 proverbs selected from six dialects.
According to the indexes, there are 6 in the Creole of French
Guyana; 28 in the Creole of Hayti; 51 in the Creole of
New Orleans, Louisiana; 101 in the Creole of Martinique;
110 in the Creole of Mauritius; 52 in the Creole of Trinidad.
Most of the proverbs are similar to our own, but are translated
into the simple homely language of the Creole,
reflecting its mode of thought. The same proverb often
appears in the different dialects. Although a proverb is
of European origin, "the character of Creole folk-lore
is very different from European folk-lore in the matter of
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;159]</span>
superstition." Many proverbs are direct from the African.
Those in the Creole of Hayti are generally rough and
coarse. The most popular subjects are, pot or kettle, rain,
serpent or snake, of which there are six of each; devil, eggs,
belly, horse, mothers, tail, of these there are seven of each;
chicken, children, ox have eight of each; cat has nine;
goat has eleven; talking has sixteen; monkey has
seventeen; fine clothes has only four, idleness has five,
and marriage has six.</p>

<p class="indent">Hearn speaks of this book as a Dictionary of Proverbs.
He made an extensive study of the subject and in later
researches found it most helpful. "I have," he says, "quite
a Creole library embracing the Creole dialects of both
hemispheres."</p>

<p class="indent">Following are a selection of the proverbs chosen from the
different dialects:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">No. 23. <i>Bel tignon pas fait bel négresse. (Le beau tignon ne fait
pas la belle négresse.)</i> "It isn't the fine head-dress that makes the fine
negress." (<i>Louisiana.</i>)</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Tignon</i> or <i>tiyon</i>, the true Creole word, "is the famously picturesque
handkerchief which in old days all slave-women twisted about their
heads."</p>

<p class="indent">No. 44. <i>Ça qui boudé manze boudin. (Celui qui boude mange du
boudin.)</i> "He who sulks eats his own belly." That is to say, spites
himself. The pun is untranslatable. (<i>Mauritius</i>.)</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Boudin</i> in French signifies a pudding, in Creole it also signifies the
belly. Thus there is a double pun in the patois.</p>

<p class="indent">No. 256. <i>Quand diabe alle lamesse li caciétte so laquée. (Quand le
diable va à la messe, il cache sa queue.)</i> "When the Devil goes to
mass he hides his tail." (<i>Mauritius.</i>)</p>

<p class="indent">No. 352. <i>Zozo paillenqui crié là-haut, coudevent vini. (Le paille-en-cul
crie la-haut, le coup de vent vient.)</i> "When the tropic-bird
screams overhead, a storm-wind is coming." (<i>Mauritius.</i>)</p>

<p class="indent">No. 267. <i>Quand milatt tini yon vié chouvral yo dit nègress pas
manman yo. (Quand les mulâtres ont un vieux cheval ils disent que
les négresses ne sont pas leur mères.)</i> "As soon as a mulatto is able to
own an old horse, he will tell you that his mother wasn't a nigger."
(<i>Martinique.</i>)</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;160]</span>No. 324. <i>Toutt milett ni grand zaureilles. (Tout les mulets ont
des grandes oreilles.)</i> "All mules have big ears." Equivalent to our
proverb: "Birds of a feather flock together." (<i>Martinique.</i>)</p>

<p class="indent">No. 291. <i>Si coulev oûlé viv, li pas pronminée grand-chemin. (Si
la couleuvre veut vivre, elle ne se promène pas dans le grand chemin.)</i>
"If the snake cares to live, it doesn't journey upon the high-road."
(<i>Guyana.</i>)</p>

<p class="indent">No. 292. <i>Si coulève pas té fonté, femmes sé pouend li fair ribans
jipes. (Si la couleuvre n'était pas effrontée les femmes la prendraient
pour en faire des rubans de jupes.)</i> "If the snake wasn't spunky,
women would use it for petticoat strings." (<i>Trinidad.</i>)</p>

<p class="indent">No. 100. <i>Complot plis fort passé ouanga.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> (Le complot est plus fort
que l'ouanga.)</i> "Conspiracy is stronger than witchcraft." (<i>Hayti.</i>)</p>

<p class="indent">"Tell me if thou hast a man (a lover) I will make a <i>ouanga</i> for
him&mdash;I will change him into a ghost if thou wilt have me for thy
husband."</p>

<p class="indent">This word, of African origin, is applied to all things connected with
the Voudooism of the negroes.</p>

<p class="indent">In the song, "<i>Dipi mo voué, toué Adèle</i>," from which the above lines
are taken, the wooer threatens to get rid of a rival by <i>ouanga</i>&mdash;to
"turn him into a ghost." The victims of Voudooism are said to have
gradually withered away, probably through the influence of secret
poison. The word <i>grigri</i>, also of African origin, simply refers to a
charm, which may be used for an innocent or innocuous purpose.
Thus, in a Louisiana Creole song, we find a quadroon mother promising
her daughter a charm to prevent the white lover from forsaking
her:</p>

<p class="indent">"<i>Pou tchombé li na fé grigri.</i>" "We shall make a <i>grigri</i> to keep
him."</p>

<p class="indent">Simultaneously with the publication of "Gombo Zhèbes,"
Hearn contributed a series of articles<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> to <i>Harper's Weekly.</i>
(221-227, 230, 232.) These papers, which are commonplace
newspaper work, tell of New Orleans, its Expositions,
its Superstitions, Voudooism, and the Creole Patois. He
feels that the Creole tongue must go, but while there is
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;161]</span>
still time, he hopes that some one will rescue its dying
legends and curious lyrics.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">The unedited Creole literature comprises songs, satires in rhymes,
proverbs, fairy-tales&mdash;almost everything commonly included under the
term folk-lore. The lyrical portion of it is opulent in oddities, in
melancholy beauties.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">There are few of the younger generation of Creoles who do
not converse in the French and English languages. Creole
is the speech of motherhood, and "there is a strange naïve
sorrow in their burdens as of children sobbing for lonesomeness
in the night."</p>

<p class="indent">There is an interesting account of Jean Montanet, "Voudoo
John"&mdash;The Last of the Voudoos. He was said to
be a son of a prince of Senegal. From a ship's cook he
rose to own large estates. While he was a cotton-roller,
it was noticed that he seemed to have some peculiar occult
influence over the negroes under him. Voudoo John had
the mysterious <i>obi</i> power. Soon realizing his power, he
commenced to tell fortunes, and thousands and thousands
of people, white and black, flocked to him. Then he
bought a house and began as well to practise Creole
medicine. He could give receipts for everything and
anything, and many a veiled lady stopped at his door.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">Once Jean received a fee of $50 for a potion. "It was water," he
said to a Creole confidant, "with some common herbs boiled in it. I
hurt nobody, but if folks want to give me fifty dollars, I take the fifty
dollars every time!"</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">It is said that Jean became worth at least $50,000. He
had his horses and carriages, his fifteen wives, whom he
considered, one and all, legitimate spouses. He was
charitable too. But he did not know what to do with his
money. Gradually, in one way or another, it was stolen
from him, until at the last, with nothing left but his
African shells, his elephant's tusk, and the sewing-machine
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;162]</span>
upon which he used to tell fortunes even in his days of
riches, he had to seek hospitality of his children.</p>

<p class="indent">Hearn devotes several columns to Voudooism, telling of
its witchcrafts and charms and fetiches which work for
evil, and also of the superstitions regarding the common
occurrences of daily life.</p>

<p class="indent">In a paper on Mexican feather-work at the New Orleans
Exposition, there is this paragraph which presages his later
descriptions:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">As I write, the memory of a Mexican landscape scene in feather-work
is especially vivid&mdash;a vast expanse of opulent wheat-fields,
whereof the blonde immensity brightens or deepens its tint with the
tremor of summer winds; distance makes violet the hills; a steel-bright
river serpentines through the plain, reflecting the feminine
grace of palms tossing their plumes against an azure sky. I remember
also a vision of marshes&mdash;infinite stretches of reed-grown ooze,
shuddering in gusts of sea-wind, and paling away into bluish vagueness
as through a miasmatic haze.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">In conjunction with these articles, Hearn published in
<i>Harper's Bazaar</i> (228-229) two papers on the Curiosities
to be found at the New Orleans Exposition.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Some Chinese Ghosts</span><a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> (3) was the next book of the
New Orleans period. The first publisher to whom it was
submitted did not accept it, but Roberts Brothers finally
brought it out. "There are only six little stories," writes
Hearn, "but each of them cost months of hard work
and study, and represents a much higher attempt than
anything in the 'Stray Leaves.'" The book is dedicated
to his friend Mr. Krehbiel, and the Dedication, which
is given in the Bibliography, is as unique as the tales
themselves.</p>

<p class="indent">In the Preface Hearn says that while preparing these
legends he sought for "weird beauty." The era of fierce
passions and horror is waning, and in these six perfect tales
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;163]</span>
there is a new-found restraint, a firmer handling of the
brush in more normal colours.</p>

<p class="indent">One of the earliest reviews of his work remarks:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">"In his treatment of the legend lore of the Celestial
Empire, Mr. Hearn has, if possible, been even more delicate
and charming than in the stories which go to make the
previous volume, so much so, indeed, that one is persuaded
to full belief in the beauty and witchery of the almond-eyed
heroines of his pages." (322.)</p>

<p class="indent">The opening story is of the beautiful Ko-Ngai, daughter
of Kouan-Yu, whose divine loyalty to her father never
faltered even at a hideous death. He was a great bellmaker,
and the Mandarin ordered that he should make a
bell of such size that it would be heard for one hundred <i>li</i>,
and further that the bell "should be strengthened with brass,
and deepened with gold, and sweetened with silver." But
the metals refused to mingle. Again the bell was cast, but
the result was even worse, and the Son of Heaven was very
angry; and this word was sent to Kouan-Yu:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">"If thou fail a third time in fulfilling our command, thy head shall
be severed from thy neck."</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">When the lovely Ko-Ngai heard this, she sold her jewels,
and paid a great price to an astrologer, and it was told to
her:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">Gold and brass will never meet in wedlock, silver and iron never
will embrace, until the flesh of a maiden be melted in the crucible;
until the blood of a virgin be mingled with the metals in their fusion.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">Ko-Ngai told no one what she had heard. The awful
hour for the heroic effort of the final casting arrived.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">All the workmen wrought their tasks in silence; there was no sound
heard but the muttering of the fires. And the muttering deepened
into a roar of typhoons approaching, and the blood-red lake of metal
slowly brightened like the vermilion of a sunrise, and the vermilion
was transmuted into a radiant glow of gold, and the gold whitened
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;164]</span>
blindingly, like the silver face of a full moon. Then the workers
ceased to feed the raving flame, and all fixed their eyes upon the eyes
of Kouan-Yu; and Kouan-Yu prepared to give the signal to cast.</p>

<p class="indent">But ere ever he lifted his finger, a cry caused him to turn his head;
and all heard the voice of Ko-Ngai sounding sharply sweet as a
bird's song above the great thunder of the fires,&mdash;"For thy sake,
O my Father!" And even as she cried, she leaped into the white
flood of metal; and the lava of the furnace roared to receive her, and
spattered monstrous flakes of flame to the roof, and burst over the
verge of the earthen crater, and cast up a whirling fountain of many-coloured
fires, and subsided quakingly, with lightnings and with
thunders and with mutterings.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">Of the lovely Ko-Ngai no trace remained save a little
shoe, which was left in the hand of the faithful serving-woman
who had striven to catch her as she leaped into the
flame.</p>

<p class="indent">And ever does the bell, whose tones are deeper and
mellower and mightier than the tones of any other bell,
utter the name of Ko-Ngai; and ever between the mighty
strokes there is a low moaning heard, a sobbing of "<i>Hiai!</i>"
and that they say is Ko-Ngai crying for her little shoe.</p>

<p class="indent">The next tale tells of Ming-Y and how it was that he did
not heed the counsel of the words of Lao-Tseu, and so it
befell that he was loved by the beautiful Sië-Thao, whose
tomb had many years ago crumbled to ruins.</p>

<p class="indent">The Legend of Tchi-Niu is the queen flower of the
nosegay of six. Tong's father died, and as they were very
poor, the only way that Tong could obtain money to pay
for the funeral expenses was to sell himself as a slave. The
years passed, and he worked without rest or pay, but never
a complaint did he utter. At length the fever of the ricefields
seized him, and he was left alone in his sickness, for
there was no one to wait on him. One noon he dreamed
that a beautiful woman bent over him and touched his
forehead with her hand. And Tong opened his eyes, and
he saw the lovely person of whom he had dreamed. "I
have come to restore thy strength and to be thy wife.
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;165]</span>
Arise and worship with me." And reading his thoughts
she said, "I will provide."</p>

<p class="indent">"And together they worshipped Heaven and Earth.
Thus she became his wife."</p>

<p class="indent">But all that Tong knew of his wife was that her name
was Tchi. And the fame of the weaving of Tchi spread
far, and people came to see her beautiful work. One
morning Tchi gave to her husband a document. It was
his freedom that she had bought.</p>

<p class="indent">Later the silk-loom remained untouched, for Tchi gave
birth to a son. And the boy was not less wonderful than
his mother.</p>

<p class="indent">Now it came to the Period of the Eleventh Moon.
Suddenly one night, Tchi led Tong to the cradle where
their son slumbered, and as she did so a great fear and
awe came over Tong, and the sweet tender voice breathed
to him:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">"Lo! my beloved, the moment has come in which I must forsake
thee; for I was never of mortal born, and the Invisible may incarnate
themselves for a time only. Yet I leave with thee the pledge of our
love,&mdash;this fair son, who shall ever be to thee as faithful and as fond
as thou thyself hast been. Know, my beloved, that I was sent to thee
even by the Master of Heaven, in reward of thy filial piety, and that
I must now return to the glory of His house: I AM THE GODDESS
TCHI-NIU."</p>

<p class="indent">Even as she ceased to speak, the great glow faded, and Tong,
reopening his eyes, knew that she had passed away for ever,&mdash;mysteriously
as pass the winds of heaven, irrevocably as the light of a flame
blown out. Yet all the doors were barred, all the windows unopened.
Still the child slept, smiling in his sleep. Outside, the darkness was
breaking; the sky was brightening swiftly; the night was past. With
splendid majesty the East threw open high gates of gold for the coming
of the sun; and, illuminated by the glory of his coming, the
vapours of morning wrought themselves into marvellous shapes of
shifting colour,&mdash;into forms weirdly beautiful as the silken dreams
woven in the loom of Tchi-Niu.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">Another tale is that of Mara, who tempted in vain, for
the Indian pilgrim conquered.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;166]</span>And still, as a mist of incense, as a smoke of universal sacrifice,
perpetually ascends to heaven from all the lands of earth the pleasant
vapour TE, created for the refreshment of mankind by the power of
a holy vow, the virtue of a pious atonement.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">Like unto the Tale of the Great Bell, Pu, convinced that
a soul cannot be divided,</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">entered the flame, and yielded up his ghost in the embrace of the
Spirit of the Furnace, giving his life for the life of his work,&mdash;his soul
for the soul of his Vase.</p>

<p class="indent">And when the workmen came upon the tenth morning to take forth
the porcelain marvel, even the bones of Pu had ceased to be; but lo!
the Vase lived as they looked upon it: seeming to be flesh moved by
the utterance of a Word, creeping to the titillation of a Thought. And
whenever tapped by the finger, it uttered a voice and a name,&mdash;the
voice of its maker, the name of its creator: PU.</p>

<p class="indent">This same year, Hearn contributed to <i>Harpers Bazaar</i>
the valiant legend of "Rabyah's Last Ride"(234)&mdash;Rabyah
upon whom no woman had ever called in vain, and who
defended his women even after he was dead. This tale
was copied in the <i>Times-Democrat</i>.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Chita</span><a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> (4), although published after Hearn left New
Orleans, properly belongs to that period. It first appeared
in much shorter form in the <i>Times-Democrat</i> under the
title of "Torn Letters." This version met with many
warm friends, and the author was urged to enlarge it. He
did so, and Harpers accepted the story, publishing it first
as a serial in their magazine. With this book came
Hearn's first recognition, and because of its success, he was
given a commission by Harpers for further studies in the
tropics, which eventuated in the volume, "Two Years in
the French West Indies."</p>

<p class="indent">"Chita" is the first glimpse of what Mr. Hearn could
write from out himself; for whereas, as always, the plot
must be given to him, the thread here is so frail that what
we admire and remember is the fabric itself which only
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;167]</span>
Hearn could have woven. In "Chita" he recreates
elemental nature. In "Karma" he becomes the conscience
of a human being. Then, for the first time he realizes the
spiritual forces which are stronger than life or death, and
without which no beauty exists.</p>

<p class="indent">A criticism of "Chita" at the time of its publication
says:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">"By right of this single but profoundly remarkable book,
Mr. Hearn may lay good claim to the title of the American
Victor Hugo ... so living a book has scarcely been
given to our generation." (342.)</p>

<p class="indent">Concerning the story, Hearn himself writes as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">"Chita" was founded on the fact of a child saved from the Lost
Island disaster by some Louisiana fishing-folk, and brought up by
them. Years after a Creole hunter recognized her, and reported her
whereabouts to relatives. These, who were rich, determined to bring
her up as young ladies are brought up in the South, and had her sent
to a convent. But she had lived the free healthy life of the coast, and
could not bear the convent; she ran away from it, married a fisherman,
and lives somewhere down there now,&mdash;the mother of multitudinous
children.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">This slight structure of plot gave Hearn the opportunity
to paint a marvellous picture. Hundreds of quotations
could be given. He is delighted with the rich glory of the
tropics, and by his power of word imagery he so reproduces
it that with him we too can see and feel it. In this
glowing Nature the poisoned beauty of the Orient is
forgotten. Take this description:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">The charm of a single summer day on these island shores is something
impossible to express, never to be forgotten. Rarely, in the
paler zones, do earth and heaven take such luminosity: those will
best understand me who have seen the splendour of a West Indian
sky. And yet there is a tenderness of tint, a caress of colour, in these
Gulf-days which is not of the Antilles,&mdash;a spirituality, as of eternal
tropical spring. It must have been to even such a sky that Xenophanes
lifted up his eyes of old when he vowed the Infinite Blue was
God;&mdash;it was indeed under such a sky that De Soto named the vastest
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;168]</span>
and grandest of Southern havens Espiritu Santo,&mdash;the Bay of the
Holy Ghost. There is a something unutterable in this bright Gulf-air
that compels awe,&mdash;something vital, something holy, something
pantheistic and reverentially the mind asks itself if what the eye
beholds is not the &#960;&#957;&#949;&#8166;&#956;&#945; indeed, the Infinite Breath, the Divine Ghost,
the Great Blue Soul of the Unknown. All, all is blue in the calm,&mdash;save
the low land under your feet, which you almost forget, since it
seems only as a tiny green flake afloat in the liquid eternity of day.
Then slowly, caressingly, irresistibly, the witchery of the Infinite grows
upon you: out of Time and Space you begin to dream with open eyes,&mdash;to
drift into delicious oblivion of facts,&mdash;to forget the past, the
present, the substantial,&mdash;to comprehend nothing but the existence of
that infinite Blue Ghost as something into which you would wish to
melt utterly away for ever.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">So it is told that into this perfect peace one August day
in 1856, a scarlet sun sank in a green sky, and a moonless
night came.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">Then the Wind grew weird. It ceased being a breath; it became
a Voice moaning across the world hooting,&mdash;uttering nightmare
sounds,&mdash;<i>Whoo!</i>&mdash;<i>whoo!</i>&mdash;<i>whoo!</i>&mdash;and with each stupendous owl-cry
the mooing of the waters seemed to deepen, more and more
abysmally, through all the hours of darkness.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">Morning dawned with great rain: the steamer <i>Star</i>
was due that day. No one dared to think of it. "Great
God!" some one shrieked,&mdash;"She is coming!"</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">On she came, swaying, rocking, plunging,&mdash;with a great whiteness
wrapping her about like a cloud, and moving with her moving,&mdash;a
tempest-whirl of spray;&mdash;ghost-white and like a ghost she came, for
her smoke-stacks exhaled no visible smoke&mdash;the wind devoured it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">And still the storm grew fiercer. On shore the guests
at the hotel danced with a feverish reckless gaiety.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">Again the <i>Star</i> reeled, and shuddered, and turned, and began to
drag away from the great building and its lights,&mdash;away from the
voluptuous thunder of the grand piano,&mdash;even at that moment outpouring
the great joy of Weber's melody orchestrated by Berlioz:
<i>l'Invitatiòn à la Valse</i>,&mdash;with its marvellous musical swing.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;169]</span>
&mdash;"Waltzing!" cried the captain. "God help them!&mdash;God help
us all now!... The Wind waltzes to-night, with the Sea for his
partner." ...</p>

<p class="indent">O the stupendous Valse-Tourbillon! O the mighty Dancer!
One-two&mdash;three! From north-east to east, from east to south-east,
from south-east to south: then from the south he came, whirling the
Sea in his arms....</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">And so the hurricane passed, and the day reveals utter
wreck and desolation. "There is plunder for all&mdash;birds
and men."</p>

<p class="indent">At a fishing village on the coast on this same night of
the storm Carmen, the good wife of Feliu, dreamed&mdash;above
the terrors of the tempest which shattered her sleep&mdash;once
again the dream that kept returning of her little Concha,
her first-born who slept far away in the old churchyard at
Barcelona. And this night she dreamed that her waxen
Virgin came and placed in her arms the little brown child
with the Indian face, and the face became that of her dead
Conchita.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">And Carmen wished to thank the Virgin for that priceless bliss, and
lifted up her eyes; but the sickness of ghostly fear returned upon her
when she looked; for now the Mother seemed as a woman long dead,
and the smile was the smile of fleshlessness, and the places of the
eyes were voids and darknesses.... And the sea sent up so vast a
roar that the dwelling rocked.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<p class="indent">Feliu and his men find the tide heavy with human dead
and the sea filled with wreckage. Through this floatage
Feliu detects a stir of life ... he swims to rescue a little
baby fast in the clutch of her dead mother.</p>

<p class="indent">To Carmen it is the meaning of her dream. The child
has been sent by the Virgin. The tale leads on through
the growing life of Chita. Finally one day Dr. La Brierre,
whose wife and child had been lost in the famous storm, is
summoned to Viosca's Point to the deathbed of his father's
old friend, who is dying of the fever. It is Feliu who
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;170]</span>
brings him. But before they can reach the Point the man
has already died. The Doctor remains at Feliu's fishing
smack. He feels the sickness of the fever coming over
him. Then he sees Chita.... Hers is the face of his
dead Adèle. Through the fury of the fever, which has
now seized him, the past is mingled with the present. He
re-lives the agony of that death-storm, re-lives all the horror
of that scene, when all that he held dear was swept away&mdash;until
his own soul passes out into the night.</p>

<p class="indent">The description of Dr. La Brierre in the throes of the
fever is terrible. It is so realistic that one shudders.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Two Years in the French West Indies</span><a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> (6) was
the <i>pièce de résistance</i> of the sojourn in the tropics. Some
of the papers appeared first in <i>Harper's Magazine</i>. They
are marvellous colour-pictures of the country, its people,
its life, its customs, with many of the picturesque legends
and the quaintnesses that creep into the heart.</p>

<p class="indent">"There is not a writer who could have so steeped himself
in this languorous Creole life and then tell so well about
it. Trollope and Froude give you the hard, gritty facts,
and Lafcadio Hearn the sentiment and poetry of this
beautiful island." (387.)</p>

<p class="indent">More and more is Hearn realizing the necessity of finding
new colour. "I hope to be able to take a trip to New
Mexico in the summer just to obtain literary material, sun-paint,
tropical colour, etc." It is always the intense that
his fancy craves, and indeed <i>must</i> have in order to work.
"There are tropical lilies which are venomous, but they
are more beautiful than the frail and icy white lilies of the
North." "Whenever I receive a new and strong impression,
even in a dream, I write it down, and afterwards
develop it at leisure.... There are impressions of blue
light and gold and green, correlated to old Spanish legend,
which can be found only south of this line." "I will write
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;171]</span>
you a little while I am gone,&mdash;if I can find a little strange
bit of tropical colour to spread on the paper,&mdash;like the fine
jewel-dust of scintillant moth-wings." "Next week I go
away to hunt up some tropical or semi-tropical impressions."</p>

<p class="indent">He is bewitched by St. Pierre&mdash;"I love this quaint,
whimsical, wonderfully coloured little town." On opening
the present volume we at once feel how thoroughly sympathetic
this whole Nature is to him, how ravished his
senses are with all that she portrays.</p>

<p class="indent">From Pier 49, East River, New York, we travel with
Hearn through days of colour and beauty to the glorious
Caribbean Sea, where we sail on to Roseau and St. Pierre.
Here the colour is becoming so intense that the eyes are
blinded.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">The luminosities of tropic foliage could only be imitated in fire. He
who desires to paint a West Indian forest,&mdash;a West Indian landscape,&mdash;must
take his view from some great height, through which the
colours come to his eye softened and subdued by distance,&mdash;toned
with blues or purples by the astonishing atmosphere.</p>

<p class="indent">... It is sunset as I write these lines, and there are witchcrafts of
colour. Looking down the narrow, steep street opening to the bay,
I see the motionless silhouette of the steamer on a perfectly green sea,&mdash;under
a lilac sky,&mdash;against a prodigious orange light.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">Over her memoried paths we wander with Josephine, and
then we pause before the lovely statue which seems a
living presence.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">She is standing just in the centre of the Savane, robed in the fashion
of the First Empire, with gracious arms and shoulders bare: one hand
leans upon a medallion bearing the eagle profile of Napoleon....
Seven tall palms stand in a circle around her, lifting their comely
heads into the blue glory of the tropic day. Within their enchanted
circle you feel that you tread holy ground,&mdash;the sacred soil of artist
and poet;&mdash;here the recollections of memoir-writers vanish away; the
gossip of history is hushed for you; you no longer care to know how
rumour has it that she spoke or smiled or wept: only the bewitchment
of her lives under the thin, soft, swaying shadows of those feminine
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;172]</span>
palms.... Over violet space of summer sea, through the vast splendour
of azure light, she is looking back to the place of her birth, back
to beautiful drowsy Trois-Islets,&mdash;and always with the same half-dreaming,
half-plaintive smile,&mdash;unutterably touching....</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">"Under a sky always deepening in beauty" we steam
on to the level, burning, coral coast of Barbadoes. Then
on past to Demerara.</p>

<p class="indent">We pass through all the quaint beautiful old towns and
islands. We see their wonders of sky and sea and flowers.
We see their people and all that great race of the mixed
blood.</p>

<p class="indent">With dear old Jean-Marie we wait for the return of
Les Porteuses, and we hear his call:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">"<i>Coument ou yé, chè? coument ou kallé?</i>" ... (How art thou,
dear?&mdash;how goes it with thee?)</p>

<p class="indent">And they mostly make answer, "<i>Toutt douce, chè,&mdash;et ou?</i>" (All
sweetly, dear,&mdash;and thou?) But some, over-weary, cry to him, "<i>Ah!
déchârgé moin vite, chè! moin lasse, lasse!</i>" (Unload me quickly,
dear; for I am very, very weary.) Then he takes off their burdens,
and fetches bread for them, and says foolish little things to make them
laugh. And they are pleased and laugh, just like children, as they sit
right down on the road there to munch their dry bread.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">Again we follow on: this time to La Grande Anse,
where we see the powerful surf-swimmers. With the population
we turn out to witness the procession of young girls
to be confirmed; we see the dances and games; we hear
the chants, and the strange music on strange instruments.</p>

<p class="indent">At St. Pierre once more we listen to the history of Père
Labat, who in twelve years made his order the richest and
most powerful in the West Indies.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">"Eh, Père Labat!&mdash;what changes there have been since thy day!...
And all that ephemeral man has had power to change has been
changed,&mdash;ideas, morals, beliefs, the whole social fabric. But the
eternal summer remains,&mdash;and the Hesperian magnificence of azure
sky and violet sea,&mdash;and the jewel-colours of the perpetual hills; the
same tepid winds that rippled thy cane-fields two hundred years ago
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;173]</span>
still blow over Sainte-Marie; the same purple shadows lengthen and
dwindle and turn with the wheeling of the sun. God's witchery still
fills this land; and the heart of the stranger is even yet snared by the
beauty of it; and the dreams of him that forsakes it will surely be
haunted&mdash;even as were thine own, Père Labat&mdash;by memories of its
Eden-summer: the sudden leap of the light over a thousand peaks in
the glory of a tropic dawn,&mdash;the perfumed peace of enormous azure
noons,&mdash;and shapes of palm, wind-rocked in the burning of colossal
sunsets,&mdash;and the silent flickering of the great fire-flies, through the
lukewarm darkness, when mothers call their children home.... '<i>Mi
fanal Pè Labatt!&mdash;mi Pè Labatt ka vini pouend ou!</i>'"</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">Then we see the lights of the shrines that will protect us
from the Zombi and the Moun-Mo, and all the terrible
beings who are filled with witchcraft; and we listen to the
tale of that Zombi who likes to take the shape of a lissome
young negress.</p>

<p class="indent">By this time it is Carnival Week with its dances and
games and maskers. But a little later we are shuddering
at the horrible pestilence Vérette that has seized the city.
A gleam of the old love of horror is caught in the following
quotation:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">She was the prettiest, assuredly, among the pretty shop-girls of the
Grande Rue,&mdash;a rare type of <i>sang-mêlée</i>. So oddly pleasing, the young
face, that once seen, you could never again dissociate the recollection
of it from the memory of the street. But one who saw it last night
before they poured quick-lime upon it could discern no features,&mdash;only
a dark brown mass, like a fungus, too frightful to think about.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">At the beautiful Savane du Fort our eyes and hearts are
gladdened by the quaint sight of the Blanchisseuses with
their snowy linen spread out for miles along the river's
bank. Their laughter echoes in our ears, and we try to
catch the words of their little songs.</p>

<p class="indent">One warm and starry, and to us unforgettable, September
morning we make the ascent of Mt. Pelée by the way of
Morne St. Martin, and on our way we come to know the
country that lies all around. Let me quote our sensation
as we reach the summit:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;174]</span>At the beginning, while gazing south, east, west, to the rim of the
world, all laughed, shouted, interchanged the quick delight of new
impressions: every face was radiant.... Now all look serious; none
speaks.... Dominating all, I think, is the consciousness of the awful
antiquity of what one is looking upon,&mdash;such a sensation, perhaps, as
of old found utterance in that tremendous question of the Book of Job:
"<i>Wast thou brought forth before the hills?</i>"</p>

<p class="indent">And the blue multitudes of the peaks, the perpetual congregation of
the mornes, seem to chorus in the vast resplendence,&mdash;telling of
Nature's eternal youth, and the passionless permanence of that about
us and beyond us and beneath,&mdash;until something like the fulness of a
grief begins to weigh at the heart.... For all this astonishment of
beauty, all this majesty of light and form and colour, will surely endure,&mdash;marvellous
as now,&mdash;after we shall have lain down to sleep where
no dreams come, and may never arise from the dust of our rest to look
upon it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">Another day we are laughing at the little <i>ti canotié</i> who
in the queerest tiny boats surround a steamer as soon as
she drops anchor. These are the boys who dive for coins.
A sad tale is told of Maximilien and Stréphane. Again
our hearts are moved by the pathos and the tragedy of La
Fille de Couleur; and in this chapter we find that characteristic
description:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">I refer to the celebrated attire of the pet slaves and <i>belles affranchies</i>
of the old colonial days. A full costume,&mdash;including violet or crimson
"petticoat" of silk or satin; chemise with half-sleeves, and much embroidery
and lace; "trembling-pins" of gold (<i>zépingue tremblant</i>) to
attach the folds of the brilliant Madras turban; the great necklace of
three or four strings of gold beads bigger than peas (<i>collier-choux</i>);
the ear-rings, immense but light as egg-shells (<i>zanneaux-à-clous</i> or
<i>zanneaux-chenilles</i>); the bracelets (<i>portes-bonheur</i>); the studs (<i>boutons-à-clous</i>);
the brooches, not only for the turban, but for the chemise,
below the folds of the showy silken foulard or shoulder-scarf,&mdash;would
sometimes represent over five thousand francs' expenditure. This
gorgeous attire is becoming less visible every year: it is now rarely
worn except on very solemn occasions,&mdash;weddings, baptisms, first communions,
confirmations. The <i>da</i> (nurse) or "<i>porteuse-de-baptême</i>" who
bears the baby to church, holds it at the baptismal font, and afterwards
carries it from house to house in order that all the friends of the family
may kiss it, is thus attired: but now-a-days, unless she be a professional
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;175]</span>
(for there are professional <i>das</i>, hired only for such occasions), she
usually borrows the jewellery. If tall, young, graceful, with a rich
gold tone of skin, the effect of her costume is dazzling as that of a
Byzantine Virgin. I saw one young <i>da</i> who, thus garbed, scarcely
seemed of the earth and earthly;&mdash;there was an Oriental something
in her appearance difficult to describe,&mdash;something that made you
think of the Queen at Sheba going to visit Solomon. She had brought
a merchant's baby, just christened, to receive the caresses of the
family at whose house I was visiting; and when it came to my turn to
kiss it, I confess I could not notice the child: I saw only the beautiful
dark face, coiffed with orange and purple, bending over it, in an
illumination of antique gold. What a <i>da</i>!... She represented really
the type of that <i>belle affranchie</i> of other days, against whose fascination
special sumptuary laws were made: romantically she imaged for
me the supernatural godmothers and Cinderellas of the Creole fairy-tales.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">Still we have much to learn about the little creatures in
the shapes of ants and scorpions and lizards. They form
no small part of the population of Martinique. And still
more about the fruits and the vegetables do we learn from
good Cyrillia, Ma Bonne. One longs to have a housekeeper
as loving and child-like and solicitous. We leave
her gazing with love unutterable at the new photograph of
her daughter, and wondering the while why they do not
make a portrait talk so that she can talk to her beautiful
daughter.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">And day by day the artlessness of this exotic humanity touches you
more;&mdash;day by day this savage, somnolent, splendid Nature&mdash;delighting
in furious colour&mdash;bewitches you more. Already the anticipated
necessity of having to leave it all some day&mdash;the far-seen pain
of bidding it farewell weighs upon you, even in dreams.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">But before we go, we must learn how Nature must treat
those who are not born under her suns.</p>

<p class="indent">Then at last reluctantly we board the <i>Guadeloupe</i>, and
with Mademoiselle Violet-Eyes, who is leaving her country,
perhaps for a very long time, to become a governess in
New York, we realize that nowhere on this earth may there
be brighter skies.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;176]</span>
Farewell, fair city,&mdash;sun-kissed city,&mdash;many-fountained city!&mdash;dear
yellow-glimmering streets,&mdash;white pavements learned by heart,&mdash;and
faces ever looked for,&mdash;and voices ever loved! Farewell, white towers
with your golden-throated bells!&mdash;farewell, green steeps, bathed in the
light of summer everlasting!&mdash;craters with your coronets of forests!&mdash;bright
mountain paths upwinding 'neath pomp of fern and angelin
and feathery bamboo!&mdash;and gracious palms that drowse above the
dead! Farewell, soft-shadowing majesty of valleys unfolding to the
sun,&mdash;green golden cane-fields ripening to the sea!...</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">Dominica, Guadeloupe, Martinique, Pelée&mdash;so they vanish
behind us. Shall not we too become <i>Les Revenants</i>?</p>

<p class="indent">It gave me no small pleasure to find that you like "Youma": you
will not like it less knowing that the story is substantially true. You
can see the ruins of the old house in the Quartier du Fort if you ever
visit Saint-Pierre, and perhaps meet my old friend Arnoux, a survivor
of the time. The girl really died under the heroic conditions described&mdash;refusing
the help of the blacks and the ladder. Of course
I may have idealized her, but not her act. The incident of the
serpent occurred also; but the heroine was a different person,&mdash;a
plantation girl, celebrated by the historian Rufz de Lavison. I wrote
the story under wretched circumstances in Martinique, near the scenes
described, and under the cross with the black Christ.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">An English notice says:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">"It is an admirable little tale, full of local characteristics
with curious fragments of Creole French from Martinique,
and abundance of wide human sympathy. It deserves
reprinting for English readers more than three-fourths of
the fiction which is wont to cross the Atlantic under similar
circumstances." (294.)</p>

<p class="indent">"Youma" is the tale of the exquisite devotion and
loyalty of a <i>da</i>. (A <i>da</i> is the foster-mother and nurse of
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;177]</span>
a Creole child.) At the death of Aimée, Youma's playmate
and rich foster-sister, little Mayotte, her child,
becomes Youma's charge. An intimate description is
given us of the Creole life of Mayotte and Youma. The
love of this <i>da</i> is very beautiful. Once with an extraordinary
heroism Youma saves Mayotte from a serpent
which has slipped into their room. With a still greater
heroism she refuses to run away with Gabriel, who has
opened the world to her,&mdash;Gabriel who has brought her
love, and whom she can marry in no other way. No, above
the pleadings of her lover, comes the voice of her dying
mistress, begging, with such trust,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">"Youma, O Youma! you will love my child?&mdash;Youma, you will
never leave her, whatever happens, while she is little? promise, dear
Youma!"</p>

<p class="indent">And she had&mdash;promised....</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">Then comes the final test of Youma's strength of devotion.
There is an outbreak among the blacks, who
have become inflamed by the dreams of coming freedom.
The Desrivières with many other families are forced to flee
for refuge in safer quarters. Under one roof all these
people gather. Youma is urged to leave and save herself.
But she will not forsake Mayotte or her master. The
infuriated blacks surround the house, and horror follows.
Presently the house is set on fire. Youma, with Mayotte
in her arms, appears at an upper window. Gabriel, "daring
the hell about him for her sake," puts up a ladder. Youma
hands him Mayotte. "Can you save her?" she asks.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">"Gabriel could only shake his head;&mdash;the street sent up so frightful
a cry....</p>

<p class="indent">"<i>Non!&mdash;non!&mdash;non!&mdash;pa lè yche-béké&mdash;janmain yche-béké!</i>"</p>

<p class="indent">"Then you cannot save me!" cried Youma, clasping the child to
her bosom,&mdash;"<i>janmain! janmain, mon ami.</i>"</p>

<p class="indent">"Youma, in the name of God...."</p>

<p class="indent">"In the name of God, you ask me to be a coward!... Are you
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;178]</span>
vile, Gabriel?&mdash;are you base?... Save myself and leave the child to
burn?... Go!"</p>

<p class="indent">"Leave the <i>béké's yche</i>!&mdash;leave it!&mdash;leave it, girl!" shouted a
hundred voices.</p>

<p class="indent">"<i>Moin!</i>" cried Youma, retreating beyond the reach of Gabriel's
hand,&mdash;"<i>moin!</i> ... Never shall I leave it, never! I shall go to
God with it."</p>

<p class="indent">"Burn with it, then!" howled the negroes ... "down with that
ladder! down with it, down with it!"</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">The ladder catches fire and burns. The walls quiver,
and there are shrieks from the back of the house. Unmoved,
with a perfect calm, Youma remains at the window.
"There is now neither hate nor fear on her fine face."
Softly she whispers to Mayotte, and caresses her with an
infinite tenderness. Never to Gabriel had she seemed so
beautiful.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">Another minute&mdash;and he saw her no more. The figure and the
light vanished together, as beams and floor and roof all quaked
down at once into darkness.... Only the skeleton of stone remained,&mdash;black-smoking
to the stars.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">A stillness follows. The murderers are appalled by
their crime.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">Then, from below, the flames wrestled out again,&mdash;crimsoning the
smoke whirls, the naked masonry, the wreck of timbers. They
wriggled upward, lengthening, lapping together,&mdash;lifted themselves
erect,&mdash;grew taller, fiercer,&mdash;twined into one huge fluid spire of tongues
that flapped and shivered high into the night....</p>

<p class="indent">The yellowing light swelled,&mdash;expanded from promontory to promontory,&mdash;palpitated
over the harbour,&mdash;climbed the broken slopes of
the dead volcano leagues through the gloom. The wooded mornes
towered about the city in weird illumination,&mdash;seeming loftier than
by day,&mdash;blanching and shadowing alternately with the soaring and
sinking of the fire;&mdash;and at each huge pulsing of the glow, the white
cross of their central summit stood revealed, with the strange passion
of its black Christ.</p>

<p class="indent">... And at the same hour, from the other side of the world,&mdash;a
ship was running before the sun, bearing the Republican gift of
liberty and promise of universal suffrage to the slaves of Martinique.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;179]</span>There are two little bits of description which are so
characteristic that I quote them:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">Then she became aware of a face ... lighted by a light that came
from nowhere,&mdash;that was only a memory of some long-dead morning.
And through the dimness round about it a soft blue radiance grew,&mdash;the
ghost of a day.</p>

<p class="indent">Sunset yellowed the sky,&mdash;filled the horizon with flare of gold;&mdash;the
sea changed its blue to lilac;&mdash;the mornes brightened their vivid green
to a tone so luminous that they seemed turning phosphorescent.
Rapidly the glow crimsoned,&mdash;shadows purpled; and night spread
swiftly from the east,&mdash;black-violet and full of stars.</p>

period, but was not published in <i>Lippincott's Magazine</i>
until after Hearn had sailed for Japan. The story is
concentrated, with its every word a shaft of light, and
it seems a wrong to attempt to epitomize it. Except in
its entirety no adequate conception can be formed of this
marvellous revelation of the anguish that a human soul
may suffer; nor of the artistic power with which Hearn
has developed and perfected his study. Many quotations
could be gleaned from his subsequent books which reflect
the inspiration of "Karma."</p>

<p class="indent">Despite her unusual intellect, the heroine had a childlike
simplicity and frankness which invited her lover's
confidence, but he had never told her his admiration, for
a dormant power beneath her girlishness made a compliment
seem a rudeness. He was often alone with her,
which is helpful to lovers, but her charm always confused
him, and his embarrassment only deepened. One day she
archly asked him to tell her about it.</p>

<p class="indent">Is there one who does not know that moment when the
woman beloved becomes the ideal, and the lover feels his
utter unworthiness? Yet, if she is one of those rare souls,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;180]</span>
the illusion, however divine, is less perfect than is her worth.
Do you know what she truly is&mdash;how she signifies "the
whole history of love striving against hate, aspiration
against pain, truth against ignorance, sympathy against
pitilessness? She,&mdash;the soul of her! is the ripened
passion-flower of the triumph. All the heroisms, the
martyrdoms, the immolations of self,&mdash;all strong soarings
of will through fire and blood to God since humanity
began,&mdash;conspired to kindle the flame of her higher life."</p>

<p class="indent">And then you question yourself with a thousand
questions, and then there are as many more of your
duty to her, to the future, and to the Supreme Father.</p>

<p class="indent">She was not surprised when he told her his wish, but
she was not confident that he really loved her, nor whether
she should permit herself to like him. Finally she bade
him go home and "as soon as you feel able to do it
properly,&mdash;write out for me a short history of your life;&mdash;just
write down everything you feel that you would not
like me to know. Write it,&mdash;and send it.... And then I
shall tell you whether I will marry you."</p>

<p class="indent">How easy the task seemed, and his whole being was
joyous; but the lightness lasted for only a moment, and
gradually all that her command meant crept over him....
"<i>Everything you feel you would not like me to know.</i>"
Surely she had no realization of what she had asked.
Did she imagine that men were good like women&mdash;how
cruel to hurt her.</p>

<p class="indent">Then for a period he was uplifted with the desire to
meet her truthfulness, but his courage failed again after he
had written down the record of his childhood and youth.
It was no slight task to make this confession of his sins.
And how pale and trivial they had seemed before. Was it
possible that he had never before rightly looked at them?
Yet why should he so falter? Surely she meant to pardon
him. He must put everything down truthfully, and then
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;181]</span>
recolour the whole for her gaze. But his face grew hot at
the thought of certain passages.</p>

<p class="indent">Hour after hour he sat at his desk until it was past midnight,
but no skill could soften the stony facts. Finally he
lay down to rest: his fevered brain tried to find excuses
for his faults. He could forgive himself everything ...
except&mdash;ah, how unutterably wicked he had been there.
No, he could not tell her <i>that</i>: instead he must lose her
for ever. And in losing her he would lose all the higher
self which she had awakened. To lose her&mdash;when he of
all men had found his ideal.</p>

<p class="indent">"<i>Everything you feel you would not like me to know.</i>"
Perhaps when she had put this ban upon him, she suspected
that there were incidents in his life which he dared not tell
her. Could he not deceive her? No, he might write a lie,
but he could never meet her fine sweet eyes with a lie.
What was he to do? And why had he always been so
humble before that slight girl? "Assuredly those fine
grey eyes were never lowered before living gaze: she
seemed as one who might look God in the face."</p>

<p class="indent">Slowly his senses became more confused, and a darkness
came, and a light in the darkness that shone on her; and
he saw her bathed in a soft radiance, that seemed of some
substance like ivory. And he knew that she was robing
for her bridal with him.</p>

<p class="indent">He was at her side: all around them was a gentle
whispering of many friends, who were dead. Would they
smile thus&mdash;<i>if they knew</i>?</p>

<p class="indent">Then there arose something within him, and he knew
that he must tell her all. He commenced to speak, and
she became transfigured, and smiled at him with the
tenderness of an angel; and the more he told the greater
was her forgiveness. And he heard the voices of the
others lauding him for his self-sacrifice and his sincerity.
Yet as they praised a fear clutched him for one last
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;182]</span>
avowal that he must make. And with the growing of
this doubt all seemed maliciously to change, and even
she no longer smiled. He then would have told her alone,
but even as he tried to hush his voice, it seemed to pierce
the quietude "with frightful audibility, like the sibilation
of a possessing spirit." Then with a reckless despair he
shouted it aloud, and everything vanished, and the darkness
of night was about him.</p>

<p class="indent">For many restless days and nights he harried himself
with bitter self-analysis; and day by day he tore up a
certain page; yet without that page his manuscript was
worthless. As the days grew into weeks a new fear seized
him that his silence had betrayed him, and that already
she had decided against him. In the face of this
danger he became terrified, and one morning he feverishly
copied the memorable page, and, addressing the whole,
dropped it in the first letter-box, before he might change
his mind.</p>

<p class="indent">Then an awful revelation of his act overcame him.
Should he telegraph her to return the manuscript unopened.
No, it was already too late. What was done&mdash;was
done for ever. He now vaguely realized what he
feared in her&mdash;"a penetrating dynamic moral power that
he felt without comprehending." He tried to steel himself
for the worst, but he knew with a premonition that
behind his imagined worst there were depths beyond
depths of worse.</p>

<p class="indent">The single word "Come" which he received two days
later confirmed his fears. When he reached the door of
her apartment, she had already risen to take from a locked
drawer an envelope which he knew was his. She proffered
him no greeting, but asked in a cold voice if he wished her
to burn the document. At his whispered <i>yes</i>, he met her
eyes, and they seemed to strip him of the last remnant of
his pride. "He stood before her as before God,&mdash;morally
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;183]</span>
naked as a soul in painted dreams of the Judgment
Day."</p>

<p class="indent">The fire caught the paper, and he stood near, in fear of
her next word, while she watched the flame.</p>

<p class="indent">At last she asked if the woman was dead. He well
knew to what she referred, and replied that almost five
years had passed since her death. To the penetrating
questions which followed he answered that the child&mdash;a
boy&mdash;was well, and that his friend was still there&mdash;in
the same place. She turned to him abruptly and coldly,
angered that he could have believed that she would pardon
such a crime.</p>

<p class="indent">He must have had some hope, or he would not have
sent the letter. Had he measured her by his own moral
standard? Certainly he had placed her below the level
of honest people. Would he dare to ask their judgment
of his sin?</p>

<p class="indent">Speechless, he writhed under the scorn of her words, and
a knowledge of shame to which his former agony was as
nothing burned within him. That in him which her
inborn goodness had taught her, was now laid bare to
himself.</p>

<p class="indent">Again she spoke after a silence&mdash;perhaps he would think
she was cruel; but she was not, nor was she unjust, for
transcendent sin that denies "all the social wisdom gained
by human experience" cannot be pardoned, it can only
be atoned. And that sin was his; and God would exact
his expiation. And that expiation she now demanded in
God's name, and as her right. He must go to the friend
whom he had wronged, and tell him the whole truth. He
must ask for the child, and fulfil his whole duty; also he
must place even his life at the man's will. And she would
rather see him dead than believe that he could be a coward
as well as a criminal. This she requested not as a favour,
but as her right.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;184]</span>
At her words he grew pale as if to death, and for a
moment she feared that he might refuse, and that she
must despise him. No! his colour rushed back, and her
heart leaped, as with a calm resolve he answered, "I will
do it."</p>

<p class="indent">"Then go!" she replied, betraying no gladness.</p>

<p class="indent">A year went by. She knew that he had kept his
promise. He wrote to her often, and passionately, but
the letters were never answered. Did she doubt him
still?&mdash;or was she afraid of her own heart? He could
not know the truth, so he waited with hopes and fears,
and the seasons passed. Then one day she was startled
to receive a letter which told her that he was passing
through her suburb, and he begged only to be permitted
to see her. To his surprise the answer brought the happy
words, "You may."</p>

<p class="indent">From the shy, beautiful eyes of the child, whom he
brought, there seemed to plead a woman's sorrow, until
her own soul answered in forgiveness. And the boy and
the father marvelled at the tenderness that had come
upon her, and the father sobbed until her voice thrilled:
that suffering was strength and knowledge, that always
he must suffer for the evil he had wrought, but she would
help him to bear the pain, and to endure his atonement.
She would shield his frailty&mdash;she would love his boy.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">The Crime of Sylvestre Bonnard</span> (21) was translated
in New York, while Hearn was finishing the proofs
of "Two Years in the French West Indies." Of it he
writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">As for the "Sylvestre Bonnard" I believe I told you that that
was translated in about ten days and published in two weeks from
the time of beginning it.... But the work suffers in consequence
of haste.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">After his departure for the Orient, two articles on West
Indian Society appeared in the <i>Cosmopolitan</i> (243-244).
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;185]</span>
They give a sympathetic study of the sad and pathetic
tragedy of the race of the mixed blood. These articles
bear a similarity to the chapter upon and the references
to this subject, in "Two Years in the French West
Indies."</p>

Hearn had been in Japan for four years; since 1891 six

<p class="indent">In many ways the present book on Japan is his happiest,
for the charm over everything is fresh and radiant. It is
here that we learn the old graceful customs, the touching
child-like ways, and the sacred appealing rites and beliefs
that so endear to us the Japanese. Later we are to have
studies more philosophical, more erudite, but none more
penetrating in virtue of the very simplicity of subject.</p>

<p class="indent">It is difficult to believe that the writer, bewitched with
the warmth and colour of the tropics, giving his pen an
unlicensed flow of word colour and enthusiasm, in a few
years could have matured into this quiet, gentle thinker
equally absorbed by the East. One finds scarcely a trace
of the Hearn of the tropics: therein lies his unique genius;
just so admirably as he reflected the West Indian life, does
he now reflect that of the Japanese.</p>

<p class="indent">It is the old Japan that Hearn loves, and the passing
of which he mourns even at the first. In his Preface, he
says, "My own conviction, and that of many impartial and
more experienced observers of Japanese life, is that Japan
has nothing whatever to gain by conversion to Christianity,
either morally or otherwise, but very much to lose." Also
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;186]</span>
in one of his letters he writes, "I felt, as never before, how
utterly dead old Japan is, and how ugly New Japan is
becoming." It is old Japan that we find in the present
volume. It is much as if we looked into a diary of his first
days in the Orient, giving his impressions and conclusions,
as well as portraying the pictures themselves.</p>

<p class="indent">One of the reviews of the book contains the following:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">"If Japan is all that he says; if the Japanese are so
compounded of all the virtues, and so innocent of the ugly
failings that mar our Western civilization, then the poet's
dream of a Golden Age has actually been realized in the
remote East. Much as we should like to believe that
such a land and such a people actually exist, we cannot
altogether conquer our doubts, or avoid the suspicion
that the author's feeling sometimes gets the better of his
judgment." (379.)</p>

<p class="indent">And another says:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">"In volume one he is still the outside observer, remote
enough to be amused with the little pretty, bird-like
glances of the Orient towards the Occident, pleased at
the happy chance which makes a blind shampooer's cry
musical as she taps her way down the street, instead of
giving her a voice raucous as that which hurts and haunts
the unwilling ears of wayfarers down Newgate Street and
on Ludgate-Hill; or complimentary to the cunning fancy
which paints a branch of flowering cherry in a cleft bamboo
on a square of faintly-coloured paper and calls the cherry
blossom 'beauty' and the bamboo 'long life.' He notices
the shapely feet of the people: 'bare brown feet of peasants,
or beautiful feet of children wearing tiny, tiny <i>geta</i>, or feet
of young girls in snowy <i>tabi</i>. The <i>tabi</i>, the white digitated
stocking, gives to a small light foot a mythological aspect&mdash;the
white cleft grace of the foot of a fauness.'</p>

<p class="indent">"A little further on the leaven of witchcraft is working,
and he cannot write so airily. It is not as a mere spectator
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;187]</span>
that he talks of his visit to the Buddhist cemetery, where
the rotting wooden laths stand huddled about the graves,
and one tomb bears an English name and a cross chiselled
upon it. Here he made acquaintance with the god, who is
the lover of little children, Jiz&#333;-Sama, about whose feet are
little piles of stones heaped there by the hands of mothers
of dead children. He is not quite as much in earnest as
volume two will find him, or he could not call the gentle
god 'that charming divinity'; but the sight-seer is dying
in him nevertheless. It was with a friend's hand that he
struck the great bell at Enoshima." (286.)</p>

<p class="indent">But even here with a new world unfolding to his
delighted eyes, it was colour that Hearn really wanted.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">I am not easy about my book, of which I now await the proofs.
It lacks colour&mdash;it isn't like the West Indian book. But the world
here is not forceful: it is all washed in faint blues and greys and
greens. There are really <i>gamboge</i>, or saffron-coloured valleys,&mdash;and
lilac fields; but these exist only in the early summer and the
rape-plant season, and ordinarily Japan is chromatically spectral.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">The opening chapter is his first day in the Orient, "the
first charm of Japan is intangible and volatile as a perfume."
Everything seems to him elfish and diminutive.
"Cha," his Kurumaya, takes him past the shops where
it appears to him "that everything Japanese is delicate,
exquisite, admirable&mdash;even a pair of common wooden
chop-sticks in a paper bag with a little drawing upon it."
The money itself is a thing of beauty. But one must
not dare to look, for there is enchantment in these wares,
and having looked, one must buy. In truth one wishes
to buy everything, even to the whole land, "with its
magical trees and luminous atmosphere, with all its cities
and towns and temples, and forty millions of the most
lovable people."</p>

<p class="indent">Before the steps leading to a temple he stops.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;188]</span>
I turn a moment to look back through the glorious light. Sea and sky
mingle in the same beautiful pale clear blue. Below me the billowing of
bluish roofs reaches to the verge of the unruffled bay on the right, and
to the feet of the green wooded hills flanking the city on two sides.
Beyond that semi-circle of green hills rises a lofty range of serrated
mountains, indigo silhouettes. And enormously high above the line
of them towers an apparition indescribably lovely,&mdash;one solitary snowy
cone, so filmly exquisite, so spiritually white, that but for its immemorially
familiar outline, one would surely deem it a shape of cloud.
Invisible its base remains, being the same delicious tint as the sky:
only above the eternal snow-line its dreamy cone appears, seeming to
hang, the ghost of a peak, between the luminous land and the luminous
heaven,&mdash;the sacred and matchless mountain, Fujiyama.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">Passing to the temple garden he wonders why the trees
are so lovely in Japan.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">Is it that the trees have been so long domesticated and caressed by
man in this land of the gods, that they have acquired souls, and strive
to show their gratitude, like women loved, by making themselves more
beautiful for man's sake? Assuredly they have mastered men's hearts
by their loveliness, like beautiful slaves. That is to say, Japanese hearts.
Apparently there have been some foreign tourists of the brutal class
in this place, since it has been deemed necessary to set up inscriptions
in English announcing that "it is forbidden to injure the trees."</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">Of Hearn's first visit to a Buddhist temple, I quote what
one of his critics has to say:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">"The silence of centuries seems to descend upon your
soul, you feel the thrill of something above and beyond the
commonplace of this every-day world, even here, amidst
the turmoil, the rush, the struggle of this monster city
of the West, if you take up his 'Glimpses of Unfamiliar
Japan,' and turn to his description of his first visit to a
Buddhist temple. Marvellous is his power of imparting
the mystery of that strange land, of hidden meanings and
allegories, of mists and legends. The bygone spirit of the
race, the very essence of the heart of the people, that has
lain sleeping in the temple gloom, in the shadows of the
temple shrines, awakes and whispers in your ears. You
feel the soft, cushioned matting beneath your feet, you
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;189]</span>
smell the faint odour of the incense, you hear the shuffling
of pilgrim feet, the priest sliding back screen after screen,
pouring in light upon the gilded bronzes and inscriptions;
and you look for the image of the Deity, of the presiding
Spirit, between the altar groups of convoluted candelabra.
And you see:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">Only a mirror, a round, pale disc of polished metal, and my own
face therein, and behind this mockery of me a phantom of the far sea.</p>

<p class="indent">Only a mirror! Symbolizing what? Illusion? Or that the Universe
exists for us solely as the reflection of our own souls? Or the old
Chinese teaching that we must seek the Buddha only in our own
hearts? Perhaps some day I shall be able to find out. (350.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">Many more temples are visited in the following chapter.
What impresses him the most is the joyousness of the
people's faith: everything is bright and cheerful, and the
air is filled with the sound of children's voices as they play
in the courts. He sees the many representations of Jiz&#333;,
the loving divinity who cares for the souls of little children,
who comforts them, and saves them from the demons. The
face of Jiz&#333; is like that of a beautiful boy, and the countenance
is made "heavenly by such a smile as only Buddhist
art could have imagined, the smile of infinite lovingness
and supremest gentleness." There is also Kwannon, "the
goddess of mercy, the gentle divinity who refused the
rest of Nirvâna to save the souls of men." Her face is
golden, smiling with eternal youth and infinite tenderness.
And he sees Emma Dai-&#333;, the unpitying, tremendous
one. He learns many things of many gods and goddesses.
There is the temple of Kishibojin&mdash;the mother of Demons.
For some former sin she was born a demon and devoured
her own children. But through the teaching of Buddha
she became a divine being, loving and protecting the little
ones, and Japanese mothers pray to her, and wives pray
for beautiful boys. At her shrine what impresses the
visitor are hundreds of tiny dresses, mostly of poor material,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;190]</span>
stretched between tall poles of bamboos. These are the
thank-offerings of poor simple country mothers whose
prayers to her have been answered.</p>

<p class="indent">In another chapter Hearn writes of the Festival of the
Dead, for between the 13th and the 15th day of July the
dead may come back again. Every small and great shrine
is made beautiful with new mats of purest rice straw, and
is decorated with lotus flowers, <i>shikimi</i> (anise) and <i>misohagi</i>
(lespedeza). Food offerings, served on a tiny lacquered
table&mdash;a <i>zen</i>&mdash;are placed before the altars. Every hour,
tea daintily served in little cups is offered to the viewless
visitors. At night beautiful special lanterns are hung at
the entrances of homes. Those who have dead friends
visit the cemeteries and make offerings there with prayers,
and the sprinkling of water, and the burning of incense.
On the evening of the 15th the ghosts of those, who in
expiation of faults committed in a previous life are doomed
to hunger, are fed. And also are fed the ghosts of those
who have no friends.</p>

<p class="indent">For three days everything is done to feast the dead, and
on the last night there comes the touching ceremony of
farewell, for the dead must then return.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">Everything has been prepared for them. In each home small boats
made of barley straw closely woven have been freighted with supplies
of choice food, with tiny lanterns, and written messages of faith and
love. Seldom more than two feet in length are these boats; but the
dead require little room. And the frail craft are launched on canal,
lake, sea, or river,&mdash;each with a miniature lantern glowing at the prow,
and incense burning at the stern. And if the night be fair, they
voyage long. Down all the creeks and rivers and canals the phantom
fleets go glimmering to the sea; and all the sea sparkles to the
horizon with the lights of the dead, and the sea wind is fragrant with
incense.</p>

<p class="indent">But alas! it is now forbidden in the great seaports to launch the
<i>sh&#333;ry&#333;bune</i>, "the boats of the blessed ghosts."</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">In Kami-Ichi, in the land of H&#333;ki, there is a glimpse
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;191]</span>
into ancient Japan, for there the Bon-odori, the Dance of
the Festival of the Dead, is still maintained. No longer is
it danced in the cities. In the temple court, in the shadow
of the tomb, with the moonlight as a guide, long processions
of young girls dance a slow ghostly dance while the
vast audience of spectators keeps a perfect stillness. A
deep male chant is heard, and the women respond. Many
songs follow, until the night is waning. Then this seeming
witchcraft ends, and with merry laughter and soft chatting
all disperse.</p>

<p class="indent">Hearn spends a long happy day at Matsue, the chief city
of the Province of the Gods, where he gathers legends and
impressions. Of course it has its temples. The temple is
the best place to see the life of the people. There it is
that the children play all day long. In the summer
evening, the young artisans and labourers prove their
strength in wrestling-matches. The sacred dances are
held there; and on holidays it is also the place where
toys are sold.</p>

<p class="indent">Often at night your attention will be drawn to a large,
silent, admiring group of people standing before some little
booth. They will be looking at a few vases of sprays of
flowers&mdash;an exhibition of skill in their arrangement.</p>

<p class="indent">Returning homeward, there is seen a poor woman
scattering some white papers into a stream of water, and,
as she throws each one in, murmuring something sweet in
a low voice. She is praying for her little dead child, and
these are little prayers that she has written to Jiz&#333;.</p>

<p class="indent">Kitzuki is the most ancient shrine in Japan, and it is the
living centre of Shint&#333;. There the ancient faith burns as
brightly as ever it did in the unknown past. Buddhism
may be doomed to pass away, but Shint&#333; "unchanging
and vitally unchanged remains dominant, and appears but
to gain in power and dignity." Many of the wisest scholars
have tried to define Shint&#333;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;192]</span>
But the reality of Shint&#333; lives not in books, nor in rites, nor in commandments,
but in the national heart, of which it is the highest
emotional religious expression, immortal and ever young. Far underlying
all the surface crop of quaint superstitions and artless myths and
fantastic magic, there thrills a mighty spiritual force, the whole soul of
a race with all its impulses and powers and intuitions. He who would
know what Shint&#333; is must learn to know that mysterious soul in which
the sense of beauty and the power of art and the fire of heroism and
magnetism of loyalty and the emotion of faith have become inherent,
immanent, unconscious, instinctive.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">At Kaka is the Cave of the Children's Ghosts. No evil
person may enter the Shin-Kukedo, for if he does, a large
stone will detach itself and fall down upon him. Here in
this great vault, lifting forty feet above the water, and with
walls thirty feet apart, is a white rock out of which drips
a water apparently as white as the rock itself. This is the
Fountain of Jiz&#333;, which gives milk to the souls of little
dead children.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">And mothers suffering from want of milk come hither to pray that
milk may be given unto them; and their prayer is heard. And
mothers having more milk than their infants need come hither also,
and pray to Jiz&#333; that so much as they can give may be taken for the
dead children; and their prayer is heard and their milk diminishes.</p>

<p class="indent">At least thus the peasants of Izumo say.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">In another cavern are countless little piles of stones and
pebbles, which must have been made by long and patient
labour. It is the work of the dead children. One must
step carefully, for the sake of these little ones, for if any
work is spoiled, they will cry. In the sand are prints
of little naked feet, "<i>the footprints of the infant ghosts</i>."
Strewn here and there on the rocks are tiny straw sandals,
pilgrims' offerings to keep the baby feet from being bruised
by the stones.</p>

<p class="indent">In the temple of Hojinji of the Zen sect at Mionoseki,
there is an altar which bears many images of Kwannon,
the Goddess of Mercy. Before the altar, and hung from the
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;193]</span>
carven ceiling, is a bright coloured mass of embroidered
purses, patterns of silk-weaving and of cotton-weaving, also
balls of threads and worsted and silk. These are the first
offerings of little girls. As soon as a baby girl learns how
to sew or knit or embroider, she brings to the Maid-Mother
of all grace and sweetness and pity, the first piece that she
has made successfully.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">Even the infants of the Japanese kindergarten bring their first work
here,&mdash;pretty paper-cuttings, scissored out and plaited into divers
patterns by their own tiny flower-soft hands.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">Among the many Notes on Kitzuki which interest, is
the annual festival of the Divine Scribe, the Tenjin-Matsuri,
to which every school-boy sends a specimen of
his best writing. The texts are in Chinese characters,
and are generally drawn from the works of Confucius or
Mencius. And Hearn remarks that the children of other
countries can never excel in the art of Japanese writing.
The inner ancestral tendencies will not let them catch the
secret of the stroke with the brush. It is the fingers of the
dead that move the brush of the Japanese boy.</p>

<p class="indent">At every temple festival in Japan there is a sale of toys.
And every mother, however poor, buys her child a toy.
They are not costly, and are charming. Many of these
toys would seem odd to a little English child. There is a
tiny drum, a model of the drum used in the temples; or a
miniature sambo table, upon which offerings are presented
to the gods. There is a bunch of bells fastened to a
wooden handle. It resembles a rattle, but it is a model of
the sacred <i>suzu</i> which the virgin priestess uses in her dance
before the gods. Then there are tiny images of priests
and gods and goddesses. There is little of grimness in the
faiths of the Far East; their gods smile. "Why religion
should be considered too awful a subject for children to
amuse themselves decently with never occurs to the common
Japanese mind."</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;194]</span>
Besides these, there are pretty toys illustrating some
fairy-tale or superstition and many other playthings of
clever devices, and the little doll, O-Hina-San (Honourable
Miss Hina), which is a type of Japanese girl beauty. The
doll in Japan is a sacred part of the household. There is
a belief that if it is treasured long enough it becomes alive.
Such a doll is treated like a real child: it is supposed to
possess supernatural powers. One had such rare powers
that childless couples used to borrow it. They would
minister to it, and would give it a new outfit of clothes
before returning it to its owners. All who did this became
parents. To the Japanese a new doll is only a doll; but a
doll that has received the love of many generations acquires
a soul. A little Japanese girl was asked, "How can a doll
live?" "Why," was the lovely answer, "<i>if you love it
enough</i>, it will live!"</p>

<p class="indent">Never is the corpse of a doll thrown away. When it
has become so worn out that it must be considered quite
dead, it is either burned or cast in running water, or it
is dedicated to the God K&#333;jin. In almost every temple
ground there is planted a tree called <i>enoki</i>, which is sacred
to K&#333;jin. Before the tree will be a little shrine, and either
there or at the foot of the sacred tree, the sad little remains
will be laid. Seldom during the lifetime of its owner is a
doll given to K&#333;jin.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">When you see one thus exposed, you may be almost certain that it
was found among the effects of some poor dead woman&mdash;the innocent
memento of her girlhood, perhaps even also of the girlhood of her
mother and of her mother's mother.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">There is a sad and awful tradition in the history of the
Kengy&#333;s, the oldest of the noble families of Izumo. Seven
generations ago the Daimy&#333; of Izumo made his first official
visit to the temples of Hinomisaki, and was entertained
royally by the Kengy&#333;. As was the custom, the young
wife served the royal visitor. Her simple beauty unfortunately
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;195]</span>
enchanted him, and he demanded that she
leave her husband and go with him. Terrified, but like a
brave loving wife and mother, she answered that sooner
than desert her husband and child she would kill herself.</p>

<p class="indent">The Lord of Izumo went away, but the little household
well knew the evil that now shadowed it. And shortly the
Kengy&#333; was suddenly taken from his family; tried at once
for some unknown offence, and banished to the islands of
Oki, where he died. The Daimy&#333; was exultant, for no
obstacle was in the way of his desire. The wife of the
dead Kengy&#333; was the daughter of his own minister, whose
name was Kamiya. Kamiya was summoned before the
Daimy&#333;, who told him that there was no longer any reason
why Kamiya's daughter should not enter his household,
and bade Kamiya bring her to him.</p>

<p class="indent">The next day Kamiya returned, and with the utmost
ceremony announced that the command had been fulfilled&mdash;the
victim had arrived.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">Smiling for pleasure, the Matsudaira ordered that she should be
brought at once into his presence. The Kar&#333; prostrated himself,
retired, and presently returned, placed before his master a <i>kubi-oke</i>
upon which lay the freshly-severed head of a beautiful woman,&mdash;the
head of the young wife of the dead Kengy&#333;,&mdash;with the simple
utterance:</p>

<p class="cnobmargin">"This is my daughter."</p>
<p class="cnotmargin">Dead by her own brave will,&mdash;but never dishonoured.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">"None love life more than the Japanese; none fear
death less." So it is that when two lovers find that they
can never wed, they keep the love death together, which is
<i>j&#333;shi</i> or <i>shinj&#363;</i>. By dying they believe that they will at
once be united in another world. They always pray that
they may be buried together. (In other books are written
additional stories illustrating the touching custom.)</p>

<p class="indent">At the temple of Yaegaki at Sakusa, are the Deities of
Wedlock and of Love, and thither go all youths and
maidens who are in love. Hundreds of strips of soft white
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;196]</span>
paper are knotted to the gratings of the doors of the shrine.
These are the prayers of love. Also there are tresses of
girls' hair, love-sacrifices, and offerings of sea-water and of
sea-weed. In the soil around the foundation of the shrine
are planted quantities of small paper flags.</p>

<p class="indent">All over Japan there are little Shint&#333; shrines before
which are images in stone of foxes.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">The rustic foxes of Izumo have no grace: they are uncouth; but
they betray in countless queer ways the personal fancies of their
makers. They are of many moods,&mdash;whimsical, apathetic, inquisitive,
saturnine, jocose, ironical; they watch and snooze and squint and
wink and sneer; they wait with lurking smiles; they listen with
cocked ears most stealthily, keeping their mouths open or closed.
There is an amusing individuality about them all, and an air of
knowing mockery about most of them, even those whose noses
have been broken off. Moreover, these ancient foxes have certain
natural beauties which their modern T&#333;ky&#333; kindred cannot show.
Time has bestowed upon them divers speckled coats of beautiful
colours while they have been sitting on their pedestals, listening
to the ebbing and flowing of the centuries and snickering weirdly
at mankind. Their backs are clad with finest green velvet of old
mosses; their limbs are spotted and their tails are tipped with the
dead gold or the dead silver of delicate fungi. And the places they
most haunt are the loveliest,&mdash;high shadowy groves where the <i>uguisu</i>
sings in green twilight, above some voiceless shrine with its lamps and
its lions of stone so mossed as to seem things born of the soil&mdash;like
mushrooms.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">It is difficult to define the Fox superstition, chiefly
because it has sprung from so many elements. The origin
is Chinese, and in Japan it has become mixed with the
worship of a Shint&#333; deity, and further enlarged by the
Buddhist belief of thaumaturgy and magic. The peasants
worship foxes because they fear them. But there are good
foxes and bad ones. The country holds legend after
legend of goblin foxes and ghost foxes, and foxes that
take the form of human beings. Every Japanese child
knows some of them.</p>

<p class="indent">Seldom is a Japanese garden a flower-garden: it may
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;197]</span>
not contain a flower. It is a landscape garden, and its
artistic purpose is to give the impression of a real scene.
Besides, it is supposed to express "a mood in the soul."
Such abstract ideas as Chastity, Faith, Connubial Bliss
were expressed by the old Buddhist monks who first
brought the art into Japan. Little hills, and slopes of
green, tiny river-banks, and little islands, together with
trees, and stones, and flowering shrubs are combined by
the artist. All these things have their poetry and legend,
and sometimes have a special name signifying their
position and rank in the whole design.</p>

<p class="indent">In the ponds little creatures such as the frog and water-beetle
live, and they too have their legends. The children
make all of these creatures and the insects their playmates.
Then there are the <i>semi</i>, which are musicians, and lovely
dragon-flies which skim over the ponds; and back on the
hill above the garden are many birds. It is not necessary
to have a garden outdoors, for there are indoor gardens
too which can even be put into a <i>koniwa</i>, the size of a
fruit-dish.</p>

<p class="indent">The dead are never dead with the Japanese; they
become even more important members of the family, for
the spirits of the dead control the lives of the living. Each
day there is some ceremony in memory of these blessed
dead; and no home is so poor but it has its household
shrine. And Shint&#333;, ancestor-worship,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>signifies character in the higher sense,&mdash;courage, courtesy, honour,
and above all things loyalty. The spirit of Shint&#333; is the spirit of filial
piety, the zest of duty, the readiness to surrender life for a principle
without a thought of wherefore. It is the docility of the child; it is
the sweetness of the Japanese woman. It is conservatism likewise;
the wholesome check upon the national tendency to cast away the
worth of the entire past in rash eagerness to assimilate too much of
the foreign present. It is religion,&mdash;but religion transformed into
hereditary moral impulse,&mdash;religion transmuted into ethical instinct.
It is the whole emotional life of the race,&mdash;the Soul of Japan.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;198]</span>
Self-sacrifice, loyalty, the deepest spirit of Shint&#333;, is born
with the child. If you ask any Japanese student what his
dearest wish is he will surely answer,&mdash;"To die for His
Majesty, our Emperor." It is impossible in this limited
space to give an adequate idea of all that Shint&#333;ism
implies.</p>

<p class="indent">The dressing of the hair is a very important part of a
Japanese woman's toilet. It is dressed once in every three
days, and the task takes probably two hours. The
elaborateness of the coiffure changes with the growing
age of the maiden. But when she is twenty-eight, she is
no longer young, and so thereafter only one style is left,
that worn by old women. Of course, there are many
superstitions about women's hair. It is the Japanese
woman's dearest possession, and she will undergo any
suffering not to lose it. At one time it was considered a
fitting vengeance to shear the hair of an erring wife, and
then turn her away.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">Only the greatest faith or the deepest love can prompt a woman to
the voluntary sacrifice of her entire <i>chevelure</i>, though partial sacrifices,
offerings of one or two long thick cuttings, may be seen suspended
before many an Izumo shrine.</p>

<p class="indent">What faith can do in the way of such sacrifice, he best knows who
has seen the great cables, woven of women's hair, that hang in the
vast Hongwanji temple at Ky&#333;to. And love is stronger than faith,
though much less demonstrative. According to an ancient custom
a wife bereaved sacrifices a portion of her hair to be placed in the
coffin of her husband, and buried with him. The quantity is not
fixed: in the majority of cases it is very small, so that the appearance
of the coiffure is thereby no wise affected. But she who resolves to
remain for ever faithful to the memory of the lost yields up all. With
her own hand she cuts off her hair, and lays the whole glossy sacrifice&mdash;emblem
of her youth and beauty&mdash;upon the knees of the dead.</p>

<p class="indent">It is never suffered to grow again.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">The "Diary of a Teacher" gives a careful picture of the
school-life in Japan as Hearn finds it. At the Normal
School, which is a state institute, the young man student
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;199]</span>
has no expenses. In return for these kindnesses, when he
graduates he serves as a teacher for five years. Discipline
is severe, and deportment is a demand. "A spirit of
manliness is cultivated, which excludes roughness but
develops self-reliance and self-control."</p>

<p class="indent">The silence of study hours is perfect, and without permission
no head is ever raised from a book.</p>

<p class="indent">The female department is in a separate building. Girls
are taught the European sciences, and are trained in all
the Japanese arts, such as embroidery, decoration, painting;
and of course that most delicate of arts&mdash;the arranging of
flowers. Drawing is taught in all the schools. By fifty
per cent. do Japanese students excel the English students
in drawing.</p>

<p class="indent">There is also a large elementary school for little boys
and girls connected with the Normal School. These are
taught by the students in the graduating classes. Noteworthy
is the spirit of peace prevailing at the recesses that
occur for ten minutes between each lesson. The boys
romp and shout and race, but never quarrel. Hearn says
that among the 800 scholars whom he has taught, he has
never even heard of a fight, nor of any serious quarrel.
The girls sing or play some gentle game, and the teachers
are kind and watchful of the smaller scholars. If a dress
is torn or soiled the child is cared for as carefully as if she
were a younger sister.</p>

<p class="indent">No teacher would ever think of striking a scholar. If
he did so he would at once have to give up his position.
In fact, punishments are unknown. "The spirit is rather
reversed. In the Occident the master expels the pupil.
In Japan it happens quite as often that the pupil expels
the master."</p>

<p class="indent">It takes the Japanese student seven years to acquire the
triple system of ideographs, which is the alphabet of his
native literature. He must also be versed in the written
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;200]</span>
and the spoken literature. He must study foreign history,
geography, arithmetic, astronomy, physics, geometry,
natural history, agriculture, chemistry, drawing.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">Worst of all he must learn English,&mdash;a language of which the
difficulty to the Japanese cannot be even faintly imagined by any one
unfamiliar with the construction of the native tongue,&mdash;a language so
different from his own that the very simplest Japanese phrase cannot
be intelligibly rendered into English by a literal translation of the
words or even the form of the thought.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">And he studies all this upon the slimmest of diets, clad
in thin clothes in cold rooms. No wonder many fall by
the way.</p>

<p class="indent">The students have been trained to find a moral in all
things. If the theme given to them for a composition is
a native one, they will never fail to find it. For instance,&mdash;a
peony is very beautiful, but it has a disagreeable odour;
hence we should remember that "To be attracted by
beauty only may lead us into fearful and fatal misfortune."
The sting of the mosquito is useful, for "then we shall be
bringed back to study."</p>

<p class="indent">There is nothing distinctive about the Japanese countenance,
but there is an intangible pleasantness that is
common to all. Contrasted with Occidental faces they
seem "half-sketched." The outlines are very soft, there
is "neither aggressiveness nor shyness, neither eccentricity
nor sympathy, neither curiosity nor indifference.... But
all are equally characterized by a singular placidity,&mdash;expressing
neither love nor hate, nor anything save perfect
repose and gentleness,&mdash;like the dreamy placidity of Buddhist
images." Later, these faces become individualized.</p>

<p class="indent">In another chapter Hearn tells of Two Festivals: one
the festival of the New Year; and the other, the Festival
of Setsubun, which is the time for the casting out of devils.
On the eve of this latter festival, the Yaku-otoshi, who is
the caster-out of the demons, goes around, to any houses
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;201]</span>
that may desire his services, and performs his exorcism,
for which he receives a little fee. The rites consist of the
recitation of certain prayers, and the rattling of a <i>shakuj&#333;</i>.
The <i>shakuj&#333;</i> is an odd-shaped staff. There is a tradition
that it was first used by Buddhist pilgrims to warn little
creatures and insects to get out of the way.</p>

<p class="indent">I quote from a French review for the description of one
of Hearn's stories:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">"But the most beautiful of all, 'A Dancing Girl,' is
drawn from the chronicles of that far-off past, from which,
say what one may, he is certainly wise in drawing his
inspirations. It is the story of a courtesan in love.</p>

<p class="indent">"At the height of her celebrity, this idol of a capital
disappears from public life, and nobody knows why.
Leaving fortune behind, she flies with a poor youth who
loves her. They build for themselves a little house in the
mountains, and there exist apart from the world, one for
the other. But the lover dies one cold winter, and she
remains alone, with no other consolation than to dance for
him every evening in the deserted house. For he loved
to see her dance, and he must still take pleasure in it.
Therefore, daily, she places on the memorial altar the
accustomed offerings, and at night she dances decked out
in the same finery as when she was the delight of a large
city. And the day comes, when old, decrepit, dying,
reduced to beggary, she carries her superb costume faded
with time, to a painter who had seen her in the days of
her beauty, that he may accept it in exchange for a
portrait made from memory, which shall be placed before
the altar always bearing offerings, that her beloved may
ever see her young, the most beautiful of the <i>shirabyashi</i>,
and that he may forgive her for not being able to dance
any more.</p>

<p class="indent">"This <i>shirabyashi</i>, from the distance of time, appears to
us here, clothed with I know not what of hieratical dignity,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;202]</span>
such as the modern <i>geisha</i> could never possess. Lafcadio
Hearn in no wise pretends in the pages he devotes to these
latter, to idealize them beyond measure. They appear
under his pen as pretty animals somewhat dangerous; but
is it not their calling to be so? Whatever be the rank of
the Japanese woman, he only speaks of her with an extreme
discretion, and with a caution that one would look
for in vain in the portrait of <i>Mme. Chrysanthème</i>. The
subtle voluptuousness of his style is never extended to the
scenes he reproduces; it is a style immaterial to a rare
degree; he knows how to make us understand what he
means, without one word to infringe those proprieties that
are dear to the Japanese, even more than virtue itself.
And to believe him, the young, well-brought-up girl,
the honest wife, are in Japan the most perfect types of
femininity that he has ever met in any part of the world;&mdash;he,
who has travelled so much. Opinions formed superficially
by globe-trotters on this subject that he scarcely
glances at because of respect, arouse as much indignation
in him as could they in the Japanese themselves. Evidently
he has penetrated into their inner life, into the mystery of
their thoughts, into their hidden springs of action, to the
point of participating in their feelings." (390.)</p>

<p class="indent">From H&#333;ki to Oki there is much to learn about the
landscapes of Western and Central Japan; and Hearn
gives many legends, and many more impressions and
intimate glimpses.</p>

<p class="indent">As there are only walls of thin paper separating the
lives of these Japanese people, no privacy can exist.
Really everything is done in public, even your thoughts
must be known. And it never occurs to a Japanese that
there should be any reason for living unobserved. This
must show a rare moral condition, and is understood
only by those who appreciate the charm of the Japanese
character, its goodness, and its politeness.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;203]</span>
No one endeavours to expand his own individuality by belittling his
fellow; no one tries to make himself appear a superior being: any
such attempt would be vain in a community where the weaknesses of
each are known to all, where nothing can be concealed or disguised,
and where affectation could only be regarded as a mild form of
insanity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">Hearn speaks of the strange public curiosity which his
presence aroused at Urago. It was not a rude curiosity;
in fact, one so gentle that he could not wish the gazers
rebuked. But so insistent did it become that he had to
close his doors and windows to prevent his being watched
while he was asleep.</p>

<p class="indent">Kinjur&#333;, the ancient gardener, knows a great many
things about souls. "No one is by the gods permitted to
have more souls than nine." Kinjur&#333; also knows legends
about ghosts and goblins.</p>

<p class="indent">An essay penetrating the very heart of the Japanese, is
the chapter on the "Japanese Smile." It crowns Hearn's
work as a superb interpretation of Japanese soul-life. This
smile is the outward and visible sign of the inward and
spiritual grace of self-sacrifice. It is metaphysically and
psychologically exquisite. It is an etiquette which for
generations has been cultivated. It was a smile, <i>in origin</i>,
however, demanded by hard heathen gods of the victims
they sacrificed; and, in history, it was demanded of the
subject race by the early conquerors. If refused, then off
came their heads! The smile is born with the Japanese
child, and is nurtured through all the growing years.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">The smile is taught like the bow; like the prostration; like that
little sibilant sucking-in of the breath which follows, as a token of
pleasure, the salutation to a superior; like all the elaborate and
beautiful etiquette of the old courtesy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">The Japanese believe that one should always turn one's
happiest face to people. It is a wrong to cause them to
share your sorrow or misfortune, and so hurt or sadden
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;204]</span>
them. One should never look serious. It is not only
unkind but extremely rude to show one's personal griefs
or anger: these feelings should always be hidden. Even
though it is death one must face, it is a duty to smile
bravely.</p>

<p class="indent">It was with such a smile that the dying boy Shida wrote
and pasted upon the wall over his bed:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">Thou, my Lord-Soul, dost govern me. Thou knowest that I cannot
now govern myself. Deign, I pray thee, to let me be cured speedily.
Do not suffer me to speak much. Make me to obey in all things the
command of the physician.</p>

<p class="indent">This ninth day of the eleventh month of the twenty-fourth year of
Meiji.</p>

<p class="indent">From the sick body of Shida to his Soul.</p>

<p class="indent">The key to the mystery of the most unaccountable smiles is Japanese
politeness. The servant sentenced to dismissal for a fault prostrates
himself, and asks for pardon with a smile. That smile indicates the
very reverse of callousness or insolence: "Be assured that I am
satisfied with the great justice of your honourable sentence, and that
I am aware of the gravity of my fault. Yet my sorrow and my
necessity have caused me to indulge the unreasonable hope that I may
be forgiven for my great rudeness in asking pardon." The youth or
girl beyond the age of childish tears when punished for some error,
receives the punishment with a smile which means: "No evil feeling
arises in my heart; much worse than this my fault has deserved."</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">This quality, which has become as natural to the Japanese
as the very breath of his body, is the sweet tonic-note of
his whole character.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Say&#333;nara!</i> Across the waters echoes the cry, <i>Manzai,
Manzai!</i> (Ten thousand years to you! ten thousand
years!). Hearn is leaving. He is going far away. His
pupils write expressing their sorrow and regret. He sends
them a letter thanking them for their gift of a beautiful
sword, and in a loving farewell says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">May you always keep fresh within your hearts those impulses of
generosity and kindliness and loyalty which I have learned to know
so well, and of which your gift will ever remain for me the graceful
symbol!</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;205]</span>
And a symbol not only of your affection and loyalty as students to
teachers, but of that other beautiful sense of duty expressed, when so
many of you wrote down for me, as your dearest wish, the desire to
die for His Imperial Majesty, your Emperor. That wish is holy: it
means perhaps more than you know, or can know, until you shall have
become much older and wiser. This is an era of great and rapid
change; and it is probable that many of you, as you grow up, will not
be able to believe everything that your fathers believed before you,
though I sincerely trust you will at least continue always to respect the
faith, even as you still respect the memory, of your ancestors. But
however much the life of New Japan may change about you, however
much your own thoughts may change with the times, never suffer that
noble wish you expressed to me to pass away from your souls. Keep
it burning there, clear and pure as the flame of the little lamp that
glows before your household shrine.</p>

<p class="indent">In a letter Hearn writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">Every day, it strikes me more and more how little I shall ever know
of the Japanese. I have been working hard at a new book, which is
now half finished, and consists of philosophical sketches chiefly. It
will be a very different book from the "Glimpses," and will show you
how much the Japanese world has changed for me. I imagine that
sympathy and friendship are almost impossible for any foreigner to
obtain,&mdash;because of the amazing difference in the psychology of the
two races. We only guess at each other without understanding.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">In another letter, speaking of the title for this book, he
continues:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">It was suggested only by the motto of the Oriental Society, "<i>Ex
Oriente lux.</i>" ... The simpler the title, and the vaguer&mdash;in my case&mdash;the
better: the vagueness touches curiosity. Besides, the book is a
vague thing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">The <i>Academy</i>, writing of "Out of the East," says:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">"Each book marks a longer step towards the Buddhist
mysticism, wherein we have lost our poet. 'The Stone
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;206]</span>
Buddha,' in the first mentioned book, is a dreamy dialogue
between the wisdom of the West; Science, with her theories
of evolution, revolution and dissolution; Buddhism, with
its re-birth on re-rebirth; and Nirvâna at the end. This
thing also is vanity. As there can be no end, so there can
be no beginning; even Time is an illusion, and there is
nothing new beneath a hundred million suns." (286.)</p>

<p class="indent">The old charm of word colour sparkles in "The Dream
of a Summer Day."</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">Mile after mile I rolled along that shore, looking into the infinite
light. All was steeped in blue,&mdash;a marvellous blue, like that which
comes and goes in the heart of a great shell. Glowing blue sea met
hollow blue sky in a brightness of electric fusion; and vast blue
apparitions&mdash;the mountains of Higo&mdash;angled up through the blaze,
like masses of amethyst. What a blue transparency! The universal
colour was broken only by the dazzling white of a few high summer
clouds, motionlessly curled above one phantom peak in the offing.
They threw down upon the water snowy tremulous lights. Midges or
ships creeping far away seemed to pull long threads after them,&mdash;the
only sharp lines in all that hazy glory. But what divine clouds!
White purified spirits of clouds, resting on their way to the beatitude
of Nirvâna? Or perhaps the mists escaped from Urashima's box a
thousand years ago?</p>

<p class="indent">The gnat of the soul of me flitted out into that dream of blue, 'twixt
sea and sun,&mdash;hummed back to the shore of Suminoyé through the
luminous ghosts of fourteen hundred summers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">And Hearn tells with charm why "the mists escaped
from Urashima's box a thousand years ago," and also of
the old, old woman who drank too deeply of the magical
waters of youth.</p>

<p class="indent">Reviewing the present volume, the <i>Spectator</i> remarks:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">"The main drift of his books, however, is to bring into
view not so much the glories of Japanese sunlight or the
charms of animate or inanimate Nature, on which it falls,
as the prevalence, at any rate in extensive sections of
Japanese society, of modes of thought and standards of
conduct which, though often widely apart from our own,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;207]</span>
demand the respect of every candid Englishman. And
certainly in this endeavour he meets with a large measure
of success. His account of the essays written and the
questions asked by the members of his class in English
language and literature at the Government college, or
Higher Middle School, of Ky&#363;sh&#363;, discloses not only what
must be regarded as a very good development of general
intelligence among those young men, but a moral tone
which in many respects is quite as high, though with
interesting differences in point of view, as would be expected
among English boys or young men in the upper forms of
our great public-schools or at the Universities. Of course,
what boys or young men write for or say to their masters
and tutors cannot by any means always be taken as sure
evidence of their inner feelings or of the character of their
daily life. But, so far as one can judge, Hearn's pupils
appear to have given him their confidence, and what he
tells us of them may therefore reasonably be taken without
much discount. It certainly illustrates an attractive simplicity
of character and thought, not untouched by poetic
imagination, together with a high development of family
affection and strong sense of family duty, and also a
remarkably high level of patriotic feeling. This spirit is
apparently inherited from the old military class of the
island of Ky&#363;sh&#363;, and it is not surprising to hear that rich
men at a distance are keen to give their sons the opportunity
of acquiring the Ky&#363;sh&#363; 'tone.' Towards the close
of his book Mr. Hearn gives an extremely interesting
account of a farewell visit paid him in the autumn of 1894
by an old pupil who had entered the army after leaving
college, and had been placed, at his own request, in one of
the divisions ordered for service in Corea:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">"And now I am so glad," he exclaimed, his face radiant with a
soldier's joy, "we go to-morrow." Then he blushed again, as if
ashamed of having uttered his frank delight. I thought of Carlyle's
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;208]</span>
deep saying, that never pleasures, but only suffering; and death are
the lures that draw true hearts. I thought also&mdash;what I could not
say to any Japanese&mdash;that the joy in the lad's eyes was like nothing
I had ever seen before, except the caress in the eyes of a lover on
the morning of his bridal.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">"A beautiful thought, the reader will agree; but why
could it not be uttered to a Japanese? A good deal will
be found on this subject in Mr. Hearn's book, and, as we
have indicated, we do not think it all holds together. His
class of students, we learn, professed to think it 'very, very
strange' that there should be so much in English novels
about love and marrying; and then he tells us that&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">Any social system of which filial piety is not the moral cement; any
social system in which children leave their parents in order to establish
families of their own; any social system in which it is considered not
only natural but right to love wife and child more than the authors of
one's being; any social system in which marriage can be decided
independently of the will of the parents by the mutual inclination of
the young people themselves ... appears, to the Japanese student
of necessity a state of life scarcely better than that of the birds
of the air and the beasts of the field, or at best a sort of moral chaos.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">"Now, of course, it is known here that in Japan, as in
other Oriental countries, it is a rule for marriages to be
family arrangements, as regards which it is expected that
the young persons will conform to the wishes of their
respective parents.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">"But of course some inconsistencies are to be expected
from an author enamoured of the whole country. He is
very Buddhist, and is anxious to show that Buddhists have
always held, in matters of faith, something very like the
doctrines of modern science with regard to the perpetual
sequence of evolution and dissolution. On this subject he
argues cleverly and effectively; but when, by implication
or expressly, he compares Buddhism with Christianity, it is
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;209]</span>
evident that the latter faith has not received any very close
study from him. None the less is his book, though dominated
by a somewhat uncritical enthusiasm, full of interest
and instruction as to the difference between the gifts, the
motives, and the mental and moral attitude of the Japanese
and the peoples of the West, ourselves in particular. It is
well worth while to study that remarkable people as they
are seen by one who is so much captivated by them, and
believes in them so strongly, as Mr. Lafcadio Hearn."
(380.)</p>

<p class="indent">The <i>Athenæum</i> does not speak so cordially, and a
review in the <i>Atlantic Monthly</i> says:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">"Mr. Hearn is not at his best as a metaphysician....
But we can forgive him in that he stands forth a staunch
champion, defying the West from the heart of the Japanese
people. He does this most clearly in his finest essay,
'Jiujutsu.' Here the very meaning of the martial exercise,
to 'conquer by yielding' is taken as text to explain the
phenomena or national awakening which foreign cities have
denounced as a 'reversal.' Japan has borrowed weapons
of force from the West, in order successfully to resist its
insidious influence. True progress is from within. Mr.
Hearn writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">However psychologists may theorize on the absence or the limitations
of personal individuality among the Japanese, there can be no
question at all that, as a nation, Japan possesses an individuality
stronger than our own." (306.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">Hearn further brings out in a conversation with a young
Japanese the fact that Japan, in order to keep pace with
the competition of other nations, must adopt the methods
which are in direct variance to her old morality, and all
that which has made the Japanese what he is. Japan's
future depends upon her industrial development, and the
fine old qualities of self-sacrifice, simplicity, filial piety, the
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;210]</span>
contentment with little, are not the weapons for the modern
struggle. In a postscript to this essay, written two years
later, after the war with China, Hearn adds that "Japan has
proved herself able to hold her own against the world.... <i>Japan
has won in her jiujutsu.</i>"</p>

<p class="indent">Japan holds infinite legends of ghostly significance, and
it is no wonder that Hearn found so much that was sympathetic.
Every new town or new temple reveals some
aspect of the odd. In this second book the joyousness is
gone; he is now a philosopher, and his philosophy reflects
much of the ghostly. The gruesome has been
buried, but it is not dead: it will return reincarnated, not
of the ghastly of real life, but of the dim, far-away,
always more distant ghostly in the lives of the dead.</p>

<p class="indent">A revelation of the Nirvâna into which Hearn is being
slowly drawn appears in "At Hakata." He has been
telling the story of the sacred mirror that a mother in
dying gave to her daughter, bidding her to look into it
every morning and evening and there see her mother.
And the girl looked and "having the heart of meeting
her mother every day," knew not that the shadow in
the mirror was her own face.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">One are we all,&mdash;and yet many, because each is a world of ghosts.
Surely that girl saw and spoke to her mother's very soul, while seeing
the fair shadow of her own young eyes and lips, uttering love!</p>

<p class="indent">And with this thought, the strange display in the old temple court
takes a new meaning,&mdash;becomes the symbolism of a sublime expectation.
Each of us is truly a mirror, imaging something of the universe,&mdash;reflecting
also the reflection of ourselves in that universe; and
perhaps the destiny of all is to be molten by that mighty Image-maker,
Death, into some great sweet passionless unity. How the vast work
shall be wrought, only those to come after us may know. We of the
present West do not know: we merely dream. But the ancient East
believes Here is the simple imagery of her faith. All forms must
vanish at last to blend with that Being whose smile is immutable
Rest,&mdash;whose knowledge is Infinite Vision.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">"The Red Bridal" is a story of <i>j&#333;shi</i>&mdash;the joint suicide
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;211]</span>
for love. These two young people had been playmates
since their early school-days, and were deeply attached
to each other. The girl's father, under the influence
of an evil stepmother, agrees to sell his daughter
to the richest and also the most disreputable man in
the village. Hearing this awful command, the maiden
only smiles the brave smile&mdash;inheritance of her Samurai
blood. She knows what she must do.... Together
she and her lover quietly meet the T&#333;ky&#333; express. As
its low roar draws nearer, they "wound their arms about
each other, and lay down cheek to cheek, very softly
and quietly, straight across the inside rail."</p>

<p class="indent">We close the book with the memory of Yuko, heroic
little Yuko, who, even as noble Asakachi, who had his
beautiful wish to die for his country fulfilled, proves that
the Japanese spirit of loyalty is far greater than our word
implies. With all her country, Yuko, a humble little
serving-maid, whose name signifies "valiant," is sorrowing
because of a Japanese attack upon the Czarevitch
of the Russians. Her soul burns with the desire to give
something that will soften the sorrow of the August One;
for the heart of the girl, being that of a true Japanese,
grieves not alone for what has happened, but with a
deeper sense of the grief caused to the August One.
The cry goes from Yuko asking how she, who has nothing,
can give; and from the lips of the dead within her comes
the answer: "Give thyself. To give life for the August
One is the highest duty, the highest joy." "And in what
place?" she asks. "Saiky&#333;," answer the silent voices;
"in the gateway of those who by ancient custom should
have died."</p>

<p class="indent">Does she falter? No.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">For her the future holds no blackness. Always she will see the
rising of the holy Sun above the peaks, the smile of the Lady-Moon
upon the waters, the eternal magic of the Seasons. She will haunt
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;212]</span>
the places of beauty, beyond the folding of the mists, in the sleep of
the cedar-shadows, through circling of innumerable years. She will
know a subtler life, in the faint winds that stir the snow of the
flowers of the cherry, in the laughter of playing waters, in every happy
whisper of the vast green silences. But first she will greet her kindred,
somewhere in shadowy halls awaiting her coming to say to her:</p>

<p class="indent">"Thou hast done well,&mdash;like a daughter of Samurai. Enter, child!
because of thee to-night we sup with the Gods!"</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">It is daylight when Yuko enters Kyot&#333;. She finds a
lodging, and then goes to a skilful female hairdresser. Her
little razor is made very sharp. Returning to her room,
she writes a letter of farewell to her brother, and an appeal
to the officials asking that the Tenshi-Sama may be begged
to cease from suffering "seeing that a young life, even
though unworthy, has been given in voluntary expiation of
the wrong."</p>

<p class="indent">At the dark hour before dawn she slips to the gate of
the Government edifice. Whispering a prayer, she kneels.
Then with her long under-girdle of silk she binds her
robes tightly about her knees, for</p>

decently composed. Then, with steady precision, she makes in her
throat a gash, out of which the blood leaps in a pulsing jet....</p>

<p class="indent">At sunrise the police find her, quite cold, and the two letters, and
a poor little purse containing five <i>yen</i> and a few <i>sen</i> (enough, she had
hoped, for her burial); and they take her and all her small belongings
away.</p>

which are greatly opposed in the West, may not be well
received.</p>

<p class="indent">"The fifteen chapters of which the book is composed,"
says a German review, "do not contain the results of any
research into the domain of politics, art or religion. They
are rather fragments from Japanese life, and so clear is
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;213]</span>
the language that the pictures given are brought home to us
with wonderful effect. Lafcadio Hearn is a journalist in
the best sense of the word. He is a writer who has something
striking and original to say upon the events of the
day, upon the conditions and institutions of a land, upon
the possibilities of development in a people, upon deep
philosophical, social and religious problems, upon the
'Idea of Pre-existence,' upon Buddhism and Shint&#333;ism,
upon the difference between Occidental and Oriental
culture, and who judges all things, all conditions that he
sees, from lofty heights. He is besides a character, a man
of great ideals; he has a fine artistic feeling and is, moreover,
able to render in wonderfully sympathetic language
tender moods which come to him at the sight of a landscape,
a work of art. Extraordinarily capable of assimilation, he,
to whom Japan has become a second home, has entirely
fitted himself into the Japanese life. He is so delighted
with the customs, with the political and social conditions,
with the simple family life, with the religion, the ceremonies,
the ancestor-worship, and with the business intercourse
carried on among themselves&mdash;which he assures us is
characterized by exceptional probity&mdash;in short, he is so
delighted with all the activities of this people that he
thinks them the best possible because they spring from the
inmost life of an ethical and never intellectual temperament.
Therefore he takes sides with them passionately against
the modern tendencies of Europe." (395.)</p>

<p class="indent">In the opening story, which I think will be found one of
his best, is portrayed the manner of a Japanese crowd in
dealing with a criminal; and how this criminal was brought
to atonement by the gaze of a little child, the son of the
man he murdered, while the little one was yet in his
mother's womb.</p>

<p class="indent">The next chapter is a discussion of Japanese Civilization.
In 1903 Hearn wrote:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;214]</span>
"The Genius of Japanese Civilization" is a failure. I thought that
it was true when I wrote it; but already Japan has become considerably
changed, and a later study of ancient social conditions has
proved to me that I made some very serious sociological errors in that
paper.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">He shows that in the wonderful development of Japanese
power, there is vitally no self-transformation. All that
Japan is, she always has been. Nor is there any outward
change. "The strength of Japan, like the strength of her
ancient faith, needs little material display: both exist
where the deepest real power of any great peoples exists,&mdash;in
the Race Ghost." He contrasts the noise and confusion
and vastness of Western cities. The construction of the
West is endurance; of Japan impermanency. The very
land is a land of impermanence. But in this impermanency
Hearn finds the greatest excellence. He contrasts how
little impedimenta the Japanese have&mdash;by that means
alone how independent they are. He shows with what a
quiet simplicity Japan has become a great commercial
centre. He fears the new Western spirit which threatens
her:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">I confess to being one of those who believe that the human heart,
even in the history of a race, may be worth infinitely more than the
human intellect, and that it will sooner or later prove itself infinitely
better able to answer all the cruel enigmas of the Sphinx of Life.&mdash;I
still believe that the old Japanese were nearer to the solution of those
enigmas than are we, just because they recognized moral beauty as
greater than intellectual beauty.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is the old spirit which found infinite meaning&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>in the flushed splendour of the blossom-bursts of spring, in the coming
and the going of the cicadæ, in the dying crimson of autumn foliage,
in the ghostly beauty of snow, in the delusive motion of wave or cloud.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">The beautiful voice of a blind peasant woman fills Hearn
with gentle memories and an exquisite delight. He muses
upon what the meaning of this charm can be; and he
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;215]</span>
realizes that it is the old sorrows and loving impulses of
forgotten generations.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">The dead die never utterly. They sleep in the darkest cells of tired
hearts and busy brains,&mdash;to be startled at rarest moments only by the
echo of some voice that recalls their past.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">The lovely spirit of showing only one's happiest face to
the world is charmingly brought out in the little incident
that, when in a railway carriage, a Japanese woman finds
herself becoming drowsy, before she nods she covers her
face with her long kimono sleeve.</p>

<p class="indent">Sometimes one may recall the dead, and speak with
them. So it happened that O-Tayo heard once again the
voice of her little child who begged her not to weep any
more, for when mothers weep, the flood of the River of
Tears rises so high that the soul cannot pass, and must
wander and wander.</p>

<p class="indent">O-Tayo never wept again, but softly she herself became
as a little child. Her good parents built a tiny temple and
fitted it with miniature ornaments, and here all day long
children came to play games with her. And when at last
she died, the children still played there, for as a little girl
of nine said, "We shall still play in the Court of Amida.
She is buried there. She will hear us and be happy."</p>

<p class="indent">The pathetic tale of Haru gives an interesting picture
of the relation in Japan between man and wife; of the
exquisite submission of the wife under the saddest conditions,
even to the moment when the little grieved heart,
which has never murmured, has the dying strength to utter
only the single word, "<i>Anata</i>." (Thou.)</p>

<p class="indent">"A Glimpse of Tendencies" analyzes many conditions
in Japan, with various predictions for her future, and speaks
of her lack of sympathy for her foreign teachers.</p>

<p class="indent">In "A Conservative" Hearn gives a searching study of
how the evils of our civilization appear to a Japanese
youth.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;216]</span>
"In the chapter, 'The Idea of Pre-existence,' Hearn
makes the interesting attempt of bringing the teachings of
the Buddhistic religion and the conclusions of modern
science into accord. The idea which differentiates the
Oriental mode of thinking from our own, which more than
any other permeates the whole mental being of the Far-East&mdash;'it
is universal as the wash of air; it colours every
emotion; it influences, directly or indirectly, almost every
act'&mdash;which inspires the utterances of the people, their
proverbs, their pious and profane exclamations, that is
the idea of pre-existence. The expression, '<i>Ingwa</i>,' which
signifies the Karma as inevitable retribution, serves as
explanation for all suffering, all pain, all evil. The culprit
says: 'That which I did I knew to be wicked when doing;
but my <i>ingwa</i> was stronger than my heart,' <i>Ingwa</i> means
predestination, determinism, necessity." (395.)</p>

<p class="indent">In his chapter on "Ancestor-Worship" it is further
proved how important a part of the household are the
dead.</p>

<p class="indent">Another delightful study is "Kimiko,"&mdash;the story of one
who turns dancing-girl out of filial piety. In the height of
her fame she falls in love with a rich young man, and he
with her. Kimiko is so good a woman at heart, that the
man's friends do not object to his marrying her. She
refuses, however, for her life has made her unworthy to be
wife or mother. The man hopes to change her, but one
day she disappears and is utterly lost to sight. Years pass
and he marries. At last Kimiko returns as a wandering
nun, looks at her lover's little son, whispers a message for
the father in his ear, and is gone once more. The grace
with which the story is told is inimitable, and the sickly
sentimentality that revolts us in the <i>Dame aux Camelias</i> is
absent. (381.)</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Gleanings in Buddha-Fields</span><a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> (10) is the third book
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;217]</span>
of the Japanese period, and was written at Kobé. In this
volume of essays, intermingled with sketches in lighter
vein, Hearn continues his philosophical studies. There are
the unmistakable signs that even this ardour is losing zest.
The charm of Japan is going fast; and after this volume,
until his final interpretation, which is a summary of all that
has gone before, is reached, we find him seeking material in
fairy-tales, legends, and even returning to old thoughts
about the West Indian life.</p>

<p class="indent">Many of his critics feel that Hearn is becoming too
subjective to be quite trustworthy; others feel that he is
still too charmed by Japan to render a faithful picture. A
review in <i>Public Opinion</i> says:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">"But, this feature of almost pardonable exaggeration
pointed out, there is little for the critic to carp at in the
majority of the eleven essays that compose the book. The
opening paper, 'A Living God,' is a perfect specimen of
the author's style, and evinces in a marked degree the
influence of Oriental environment on a sensitive mind. It
treats of the temples, shrines, and worship of the people, and
tells by legend how even a living individual may come to
be worshipped as a god by his friends....</p>

<p class="indent">"The essay, however, that betrays most strongly the
bent of the author's mental metamorphosis, and one, we
venture to say, that will be generally challenged is that
on 'Faces in Japanese Art.' The contention it embodies,
which he boldly fathers, is a flat denial of the truth and
worth of our accepted schools of art,&mdash;of drawing especially."
(376.)</p>

<p class="indent">Criticizing the chapters on Buddhism in the present
book, the <i>Athenæum</i> says:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">"They are finely written, but the Buddhism is the
Buddhism of Mr. Hearn, not of China or Japan, or of
anywhere else. Nevertheless, we think them the most
attractive of these gleanings. Laputa is placed not very
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;218]</span>
far from Japan; to a quasi-Laputa Mr. Hearn has gone,
and his Laputian experiences are more interesting than
any ordinary terrestrial experiences could have been."
(298.)</p>

<p class="indent">The <i>Spectator</i> says:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">"His chapter on Nirvâna, which he describes as 'a study
in synthetic Buddhism,' will be read with very great interest
by all who care for the problems involved. There have
been plenty of studies of the doctrine of Nirvâna more
elaborate and complete, but few more suggestive and
more taking.... Mr. Hearn begins by combating the
popular Western notion that the idea of Nirvâna signifies
to Buddhist minds complete annihilation. The notion is,
he declares, erroneous because it contains only half the
truth, and a half of the truth which is of no value or
interest or intelligibility except when joined to the other
half. According to Mr. Hearn, and, indeed, according to
'the better opinion' generally, Nirvâna means not absolute
nothingness or complete annihilation, but only the annihilation
of what constitutes individualism and personality,&mdash;'the
annihilation of everything that can be included under
the term "I".'" (382.)</p>

<p class="indent">Hearn makes an elaborate study of the varying stages of
births and heavens that one must generally pass through
before one rises into the "infinite bliss" of Nirvâna. The
chapter closes with this significant sentence:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">The only reality is One;&mdash;all that we have taken for Substance is
only Shadow;&mdash;the physical is the unreal:&mdash;<i>and the outer-man is the
ghost</i>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">There are two short chapters devoted to the Japanese
Songs. The first songs, "Out of the Street," are, as
Manyemon, who would not have the Western people
deceived, tells us, the vulgar songs, or those sung by the
washermen, carpenters, and bamboo-weavers, etc. The
theme always holds some glint of love. Hearn has
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;219]</span>
arranged certain ones in three groups forming a little
shadow romance.</p>

<blockquote>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">To Heaven with all my soul I prayed to prevent your going;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Already, to keep you with me, answers the blessed rain.</span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Things never changed since the Time of the Gods:
</span><br />
<span class="i0">The flowing of water, the Way of Love.</span>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">The second chapter is devoted to Folk-Songs with
Buddhist allusions. Nearly all the arts and the greater
number of the industries show the influence of Buddhism.
A typical song is:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Even the knot of the rope tying our boats together</span><br />
<span class="i0">Knotted was long ago by some love in a former birth.</span>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>

<p>Another:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Even while praying together in front of the tablets ancestral,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Lovers find chance to murmur prayers never meant for the dead.</span>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">On the "Trip to Ky&#333;to" there is more to be learned about
poor little Yuko, who gave her life for her nation. To the
Japanese all the small details of her story are of the
greatest importance, and are carefully treasured. Hearn
thinks that the Western "refined feeling" might not care
for the poor little blood-stained trifles; if so it is to be
regretted.</p>

<p class="indent">In "Dust," with a dainty touch, he teaches again that
we are but millions upon billions of dead people; that the
cells and the souls are themselves recombinations of old
welding of forces&mdash;forces of which we know nothing save
that they belong "to the Shadow-Makers of universes."
You are an individual&mdash;but also you are a population!
This leads on to the end that</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">In whatsoever time all human minds accord in thought and will with
the mind of the Teacher, there shall not remain even one particle of
dust that does not enter into Buddhahood.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">The last chapter, "Within the Circle," is of a philosophy
so impermanent that it seems but Shadow-play, and one
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;220]</span>
may not behold a visible form, for&mdash;like all that which it
symbolizes&mdash;it is but an illusion.</p>

the ensuing year. The effort to write is manifest; even to
himself Hearn is admitting that the <i>frisson</i> which Japan
gave him is passing. He is beginning to make copy; and
the subjects are becoming more vague, vapoury, and
ghostly.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">I must eat some humble pie. My work during the past ten months
has been rather poor. Why, I cannot quite understand&mdash;because it
costs me more effort. Anyhow, I have had to rewrite ten essays: they
greatly improved under the process. I am trying now to get a
Buddhist commentary for them&mdash;mostly to be composed of texts
dealing with pre-existence and memory of former lives. I took for
subjects the following:&mdash;Beauty is Memory&mdash;why beautiful things
bring sadness;&mdash;the Riddle of Touch&mdash;<i>i. e.</i> the thrill that a touch
gives;&mdash;the Perfume of Youth;&mdash;the Reason of the Pleasure of the
Feeling Evoked by Bright Blue;&mdash;the Pain Caused by Certain Kinds
of Red;&mdash;Mystery of Certain Musical Effects;&mdash;Fear of Darkness
and the Feeling of Dreams. Queer subjects, are they not? I think
of calling the collection "Retrospectives.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">The <i>Athenæum</i>, that wise critic, feels that in this book
Hearn "shows himself at his best. He is more subdued,"
it says, "than is his wont, and indulges less freely in
excessive laudation and needless disparagement. The
chapters on 'Insect Musicians,' on the 'Literature of the
Dead,' and&mdash;oddly as it may sound to us&mdash;on 'Frogs,' are
among the most delightful of all his writings. The keynote
of all is struck in the pretty stanza that heads the
first of the three:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i2"><i>Mushi, yo mushi,</i></span><br />
<span class="i4"><i>Naïté ingwa ga</i></span><br />
<span class="i2"><i>Tsukuru nara?</i></span><br />
<span class="i4">(Insect, O insect!</span><br />
<span class="i2">Singing fulfil you</span><br />
<span class="i0">Your fire-life and all life!)</span>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;221]</span>
"The translation is ours. The fondness of the Japanese
for many kinds of chirping insects, which they keep in
little bamboo-cages, is one of the prettiest of the surviving
echoes of the past. The plaintive little cry satisfies the
curious melancholy that characterizes the reflective moods
of the lieges of Mutsu. In the long series of changes that
is to end in perfect Buddha-forms, there is hope always,
but always tinged with the sadness of vague memories of
past pains, and the resigned dread of sorrows to come, one
knows not how oft to be repeated ere in 'Nirvâna' all
earthly moods are lost. There is a regular trade in these
tiny songsters, of the history of which Mr. Hearn tells the
pleasant story." (299.)</p>

<p class="indent">Hearn leads us to a cemetery in a quaint lonesome
garden, and teaches us something about the wonderful
texts and inscriptions that are chiselled into the stone of
the tombs, or painted on the wooden <i>sotoba</i>, and go to
form the important literature of the dead. A suggestive
<i>sotoba</i>-text is:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">The Amida-Ky&#333; says: "All who enter into that country enter
likewise into that state of virtue from which there can be no turning
back."</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">From the Kaimy&#333; which is engraved on the tomb, we
may select:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p><i>Koji</i>&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">(Bright-Sun-on-the-Way-of-the-Wise, in the Mansion of Luminous
Mind.)</p>

<p><i>Koji</i>&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">(Effective-Benevolence-Hearing-with-Pure-Heart-the-Supplications-of-the-Poor,&mdash;dwelling
in the Mansion of the Virtue of Pity.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">The frog is another favourite of the Japanese. There is
one special variety called the Kajika, or true singing-frog
of Japan, which is kept as a pet in a little cage. For over
a hundred years the frog has been the subject of numerous
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;222]</span>
poems. Many of these little verses are love-poems, for
the lovers' trysting-hour is also the hour when the frog-chorus
is at its height. Here is a quotation from the
Anthology called "Kokinsh&#363;," compiled <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 905, by the
poet Ki-no-Tsurayuki:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">The poetry of Japan has its roots in the human heart, and thence
has grown into a multiform utterance. Man in this world, having a
thousand million of things to undertake and to complete, has been
moved to express his thoughts and his feelings concerning all that
he sees and hears. When we hear the <i>uguisu</i> singing among flowers,
and the voice of the <i>kawazu</i> which inhabits the waters, what mortal
(<i>lit. "who among the living that lives"</i>) does not compose poems?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A charming frog poem is:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i2"><i>Té wo tsuité</i></span><br />
<span class="i0"><i>Uta moshi-aguru,</i></span><br />
<span class="i2"><i>Kawazu kana!</i></span>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">(With hand resting on the ground, reverentially you repeat your
poem, O frog!)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And another:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i2"><i>Tamagawa no</i></span><br />
<span class="i0"><i>Hito wo mo yogizu</i></span><br />

<span class="i2"><i>Kono y&#363; kikéba</i></span><br />
<span class="i0"><i>Oshiku ya wa aranu?</i></span>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">(Hearing to-night the frogs of the Jewel River&mdash;or Tamagawa, that
sing without fear of man, how can I help loving the passing
moment?)</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">A vivid chapter is Hearn's description of his ascent of
Fuji-no-Yama. Here he may once again use his palette
of many colours, but certainly not with the old <i>abandon</i>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">Brighter and brighter glows the gold. Shadows come from the
west,&mdash;shadows flung by cloud-pile over cloud-pile; and these, like
evening shadows upon snow, are violaceous blue.... Then orange-tones
appear in the horizon; then smouldering crimson. And now
the greater part of the Fleece of Gold has changed to cotton again,&mdash;white
cotton mixed with pink.... Stars thrill out. The cloud-waste
uniformly whitens;&mdash;thickening and packing to the horizon.
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;223]</span>
The west glooms. Night rises; and all things darken except that
wondrous unbroken world-round of white,&mdash;the Sea of Cotton.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">A lurking of the gruesome flashes out when the snow-patches
against the miles of black soot and ashes on the
mountain make him think "of a gleam of white teeth I
once saw in a skull,&mdash;a woman's skull,&mdash;otherwise burnt
to a sooty crisp."</p>

<p class="indent">"Retrospectives" is a group of gentle reveries, where we
may muse with Hearn on such elusive themes as the
"Sadness in Beauty," for beauty has no real existence, it is
the emotion of the dead within us. Or there is the
analysis of that favourite word <i>frisson</i>, "the touch that
makes a thrill within you is a touch that you have felt
before,&mdash;sense-echo of forgotten intimacies in many unremembered
lives." "Azure Psychology" and "A Red
Sunset" recall Hearn's earlier criticisms on colour.</p>

of the Japan that is to people this book and those
which are to come. In the opening chapter Hearn
crystallizes in a powerful sketch the sum of Buddhist lore.
Of this the <i>Academy</i> writes:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">"Of Nirvâna one carries away this one picture, painted
in words curiously colourless and intangible&mdash;the picture
of a mountain up whose steep side toil two creatures&mdash;the
soul and his guide&mdash;toiling, stumbling upwards over a
brittle and friable chaos of skulls. Skulls crumbled into
powder and skulls crumbling mark out the road; 'and
every skull,' says the guide, 'is yours, and has been yours
in some past incarnation; and the dust that rises round
your present body is the dust of your past and deserted
bodies that have served you well or ill as may be in your
past lives.' In the fine and bewildering haze of this
thought we lose our poet, and henceforward he is not a
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;224]</span>
face nor a voice, but an echo of a living man's voice. We
hear the echo, but the voice we do not hear. And we
grudge the voice, even to Nirvâna where all silences are
merged in one." (286.)</p>

<p class="indent">In a beautiful chapter Hearn outlines all that might be
written about the important subject of incense. He tells
a good deal about its religious, luxurious, and ghostly uses.
There is also a charming custom of giving parties where
dainty games are played with it.</p>

<p class="indent">Sometimes there can be love between the living and the
dead, or so it appears in the ghostly story of "A Passional
Karma," or O-Tsuyu, who died of love of Shinzabur&#333; and
returns to be his bride. Every night, by the light of their
Peony Lanterns, she, accompanied by her maid, comes to
keep the ghostly tryst. Shinzabur&#333; does not know that
O-Tsuyu is dead, but his servant Tomoz&#333;, overhearing
voices, gazes through a chink, and sees&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the face of a woman long dead,&mdash;and the fingers caressing were
fingers of naked bone,&mdash;and of the body below the waist there was
not anything: it melted off into thinnest trailing shadow. Where
the eyes of the lover deluded saw youth and grace and beauty, there
appeared to the eyes of the watcher horror only, and the emptiness
of death.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">Now he whose bride is a ghost cannot live. No matter
what force flows in his blood he must certainly perish.
Shinzabur&#333; is warned and an amulet to protect him from
the dead is given to him, but treachery is played, and the
amulet is stolen; so one morning Tomoz&#333; finds his master</p>

<blockquote>
<p>hideously dead;&mdash;and the face was the face of a man who had died in
the uttermost agony of fear;&mdash;and lying beside him in the bed were
the bones of a woman! And the bones of the arms, and the bones of
the hands, clung fast about his neck.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">The gentle heart of the Japanese shines in the chapter
on "Bits of Poetry." You might find yourself, Hearn says,
in a community so poor that you could not even buy a cup
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;225]</span>
of real tea, but no place could you discover "where there is
nobody capable of making a poem." Poems are written on
all occasions and for all occasions.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">Poems can be found upon almost any kind of domestic utensil;&mdash;for
example, upon braziers, iron-kettles, vases, wooden-trays, lacquer-ware,
porcelains, chopsticks of the finer sort,&mdash;even toothpicks!
Poems are painted upon shop-signs, panels, screens, and fans.
Poems are printed upon towels, draperies, curtains, kerchiefs, silk-linings,
and women's crêpe-silk underwear. Poems are stamped or
worked upon letter-paper, envelopes, purses, mirror-cases, travelling-bags.
Poems are inlaid upon enamelled ware, cut upon bronzes,
graven upon metal pipes, embroidered upon tobacco-pouches.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">A Japanese artist would not think of elaborating a
sketch, and a poem to be perfect must also only stir
one's fancy. <i>Ittakkiri</i>, meaning "entirely vanished" in
the sense of "all told," is a term applied contemptuously
to him who expresses all his thought.</p>

<p class="indent">Japan is rich in proverbs. Hearn has translated one
hundred examples of Buddhist proverbs.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent"><i>Karu-toki no Jiz&#333;-gao; nasu-toki no Emma-gao.</i></p>

<p class="indent">(Borrowing-time, the face of Jiz&#333;; repaying-time, the face of
Emma.)</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Sodé no furi-awasé mo tash&#333; no en.</i></p>

<p class="indent">(Even the touching of sleeves in passing is caused by some relation
in a former life.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">A powerful relic of the old clinging love of the gruesome
is the story of <i>Ingwa-banashi</i>. The <i>daimy&#333;'s</i> wife knew
that she was dying; and she thought of many things,
especially of her husband's favourite, the Lady Yukiko,
who was nineteen years old. She begged her husband to
send for the Lady Yukiko, whom, she said, she loved as a
sister. After the dying wife had told Lady Yukiko it was
her wish that she should become the wife of their dear lord,
she begged that Yukiko would carry her on her back to see
the cherry-bloom.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;226]</span>
As a nurse turns her back to a child, that the child may cling to it,
Yukiko offered her shoulders to the wife, and said:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">"Lady, I am ready: please tell me how I best can help you."</p>

<p class="indent">"Why, this way!" responded the dying woman, lifting herself with
an almost superhuman effort by clinging to Yukiko's shoulders. But
as she stood erect, she quickly slipped her thin hands down over the
shoulders, under the robe, and clutched the breasts of the girl, and
burst into a wicked laugh.</p>

<p class="indent">"I have my wish!" she cried&mdash;"I have my wish for the cherry-bloom,
but not the cherry-bloom of the garden!... I could not die
before I got my wish. Now I have it!&mdash;oh, what a delight!"</p>

<p class="indent">And with these words she fell forward upon the crouching girl, and
died.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">When the attendants tried to lift the body from Yukiko's
shoulders, they found that the hands of the dead had grown
into the quick flesh of the breasts of the girl. And they
could not be removed. A skilful physician was called, and
he decided that the hands could be amputated only at the
wrists, and so this was done. But the hands still clung to
the breasts;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>and there they soon darkened and dried up like the hands of a person
long dead.</p>

<p class="indent">Yet this was only the beginning of the horror.</p>

<p class="indent">Withered and bloodless though they seemed, those hands were not
dead. At intervals they would stir&mdash;stealthily, like great grey spiders.
And nightly thereafter,&mdash;beginning always at the Hour of the Ox,&mdash;they
would clutch and compress and torture. Only at the Hour of the
Tiger the pain would cease.</p>

<p class="indent">Yukiko cut off her hair, and became a mendicant-nun.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">Every day she prayed to the dead for pardon, and every
night the torture was renewed. This continued for more
than seventeen years until Yukiko was heard of no
more.</p>

<p class="indent">"He gives us several essays upon matters Japanesque,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;227]</span>
which obviously involve no small amount of erudition and
patient research. Such are his papers upon the various
species of <i>Sémi</i>, or Japanese singing-locusts, and on the
complicated etiquette of Japanese female names. But the
distinctive feature of this volume is the first half, which is
given up to a collection of curious tales by native writers,
weird, uncanny, little stories, most of them, of ghouls and
wraiths, and vampires, or at least the nearest Japanese
equivalents for such Occidental spectres." (316.)</p>

<p class="indent">The <i>Athenæum</i> does not find "Shadowings" equal to the
volume "Exotics." It thinks that Hearn is "perilously
near exhausting his repertory of <i>Kokin</i> [one-stringed fiddle]
themes."</p>

<p class="indent">"The stories with which the present volume opens have
no particular merit: they have lost their chief and real
advantage&mdash;their local colour&mdash;in Hearnesque translation,
and seem to be little more than suggestions or drafts of
'nouvelles,' out of which skilful hands might perhaps have
made something much better. A good example is the
story of the Screen Maiden, which is a most lame presentment
of a charming motif. The chapters on female names,
on <i>sémi</i>, couplets and 'Old Japanese Songs' are more
interesting, but only to those who possess a considerable
knowledge of old Japanese life and literature.... Of
the 'Old Japanese Songs'&mdash;where is the proof of their
antiquity?&mdash;much the best is the dance-ballad of the
dragon-maid, who bewitched a <i>yamabushi</i>, and chased
him over moor and hill and river, until the temple of
Dojo was reached, under the great bell of which the
trembling hill-warrior or outlaw (<i>yamabushi</i> were such
originally in all probability) hid himself, whereupon the
dragon-maid wrapped her body round the bell once and
again and the third time the bell melted and flowed away
like boiling water. And with it, according to the legend,
flowed away the ashes of the unwilling object of the
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;228]</span>
dragon-maid's affections, consumed not through love, but
through disdain." (300.)</p>

<p class="indent">Strange things happen in the group of tales, and not the
least is the tale of the maiden in the screen whose loveliness
so bewitches a youth that he becomes sick unto death.
Then an old scholar tells him that the person whom the
picture represents is dead, but since the painter painted
her mind as well as her form, her spirit lives in the picture
and he may yet win her.</p>

<p class="indent">So every day, Tokkei, following out the old scholar's
injunctions, sits before the portrait calling softly the
maiden's name. And finally after many days the maiden
answered, "<i>Hai!</i>" And stepping down from out the
screen, she kneels to take the cup of wine (which was to
be so), whispering charmingly, "How could you love me
so much?"</p>

<p class="indent">Also there is the tale of the Corpse Rider, in which the
husband had to ride for one whole night, so far that he
could not know the distance, the dead body of his divorced
wife; and this was to save him from her vengeance.</p>

<p class="indent">The gruesome gleams here, and again in the tale of
"The Reconciliation," when the repentant husband found
that the wife he was holding in his arms is "a corpse so
wasted that little remained save the bones, and the long
black tangled hair."</p>

<p class="indent">There is no small amount of etiquette in the prefixes
and suffixes of the Japanese female names. The majority
of the <i>Yobina</i>, or personal names, are not æsthetic. Some
are called after the flowers, and there are also place names,
as for instance <i>Miné</i> (Peak) <i>Hama</i> (Shore); but the large
proportion express moral or mental attributes.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">Tenderness, kindness, deftness, cleverness, are frequently represented
by <i>yobina;</i> but appellations implying physical charm, or
suggesting æsthetic ideas only, are comparatively uncommon. One
reason for the fact may be that very æsthetic names are given to
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;229]</span>
<i>geisha</i> and to <i>j&#333;ro</i>, and consequently vulgarized. But the chief reason
certainly is that the domestic virtues still occupy in the Japanese
moral estimate a place not less important than that accorded to
religious faith in the life of our own Middle Ages. Not in theory
only, but in every-day practice, moral beauty is placed far above
physical beauty; and girls are usually selected as wives, not for their
good looks, but for their domestic qualities.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">I give a few names gleaned from Hearn's lists:&mdash;<i>O-Jun</i>&mdash;"Faithful-to-death";
<i>O-Tamé</i>&mdash;"For-the-sake-of,"&mdash;a
name suggesting unselfishness; <i>O-Chika</i>&mdash;"Closely Dear";
<i>O-Suki</i>&mdash;"The Beloved"&mdash;<i>Aimée</i>; <i>O-Taë</i>&mdash;"The Exquisite";
<i>Tokiwa</i>&mdash;"Eternally Constant."</p>

<p class="indent">From the "Fantasies," we read of the Mystery of
Crowds, and the horrors of Gothic Architecture, the joys
of levitation while one is asleep&mdash;with a moral attached;
of Noctilucæ. Also, as we gaze with the adolescent youth
into a pair of eyes we come to know that</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">The splendour of the eyes that we worship belongs to them only as
brightness to the morning-star. It is a reflex from beyond the shadow
of the Now,&mdash;a ghost-light of vanished suns. Unknowingly within
that maiden-gaze we meet the gaze of eyes more countless than the
hosts of heaven,&mdash;eyes otherwhere passed into darkness and dust.</p>

<p class="indent">Thus, and only thus, the depth of that gaze is the depth of the Sea
of Death and Birth, and its mystery is the World-Soul's vision, watching
us out of the silent vast of the Abyss of Being.</p>

<p class="indent">Thus, and only thus, do truth and illusion mingle in the magic of
eyes,&mdash;the spectral past suffusing with charm ineffable the apparition
of the present;&mdash;and the sudden splendour in the soul of the Seer
is but a flash, one soundless sheet-lightning of the Infinite Memory.</p>

though parted from the wrist, still writhed; and its fingers still gripped
at the bleeding head&mdash;and tore, and mangled,&mdash;as the claws of the

</blockquote>

<p class="indent">Who but Hearn would have chosen this ghastly scene,
and described it with such terrible reality?</p>

<p class="indent">With the parents we have unravelled the mystery of
Kinumé, whose spirit belonged to one family, and whose
body was the child of the other.</p>

<p class="indent">Perhaps we still see the famous picture of Kwashin Koji,
which had a soul, for "it is well known that some sparrows,
painted upon a sliding screen (<i>fusuma</i>) by H&#333;gen Yenshin,
once flew away, leaving blank the spaces which they had
occupied upon the surface. Also it is well known that a
horse painted upon a certain Kakémono, used to go out at
night to eat grass." So the water in the picture on the
screen of Kwashin overflowed into the room, and the boat
thereon glided forth, but not a ripple from the oar was
heard. Then Kwashin Koji climbed into the boat, and it
receded into the picture, and the water dried in the room.
Over the painted water slipped the painted vessel until all
disappeared, and Kwashin was heard of no more.</p>

<p class="indent">And we remember too the strange brave way that
Umétsu Ch&#363;bei won the gift of great strength for his
children, and their children's children.</p>

<p class="indent">The <i>Athenæum</i> finds the story of Kwashin the best of
this collection. Speaking of the study, "On a Bridge," it
says:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;232]</span>"The author narrates a personal experience of a <i>riksha</i>
man who drew him across an old bridge near Kumamoto.
It was in the time of the Satsuma <i>muhon</i> (rebellion), some
twenty-two years earlier, that the <i>Kurumaya</i> (<i>riksha</i> man)
was stopped on the bridge by three men, who were dressed
as peasants, but had very long swords under their raincoats.
After a time a cavalry officer came along from the city.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">The moment the horse got on the bridge the three men turned and
leaped:&mdash;and one caught the horse's bridle; and another gripped the
officer's arm; and the third cut off his head&mdash;all in a moment.... I
never saw anything done so quickly.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">"The seeming peasants then waited, and presently
another cavalry officer came and was murdered in like
manner. Then came a third, who met a similar fate.
Lastly, the peasants went away, having thrown the bodies
into the river, but taking the heads with them. The man
had never mentioned the matter till long after the war&mdash;why?
'Because it would have been ungrateful.'</p>

<p class="indent">"No doubt this is a true story." (301.)</p>

<p class="indent">It was probably during the ensuing year that Hearn
contributed to the Japanese Fairy Tale Series (15),
published in T&#333;ky&#333;, his renditions of four of these
stories.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Kott&#333;</span><a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> (16) followed. Says the <i>Athenæum</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">"The gem of this volume is 'A Woman's Diary,' purporting
to be 'the history of a woman's married life
recorded by herself, found in a small <i>haribako</i> (work-box)
which had belonged to her.' It is an ordinary story, not in
the least sensational, yet pitiful and even touching in its
record of poverty and suffering, showing the hardships and
small enjoyment&mdash;according to our notions, at least&mdash;of
the colourless existence led by the bulk of the Japanese
poorer classes upon a total family wage of twelve pounds
a year or less." (302.)</p>

Except for "A Woman's Diary" and "Fireflies" the
tales in "Kott&#333;" are fragmentary. Some are gruesome as
the history of the Gaki; or as the story of O-Katsu-San,
who was so bold as to go by night to Yurei-Daki, and who
to win her bet brought back the little money-box of the
gods. But when she came to give her baby his milk,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">Out of the wrappings unfastened there fell to the floor a blood-soaked
bundle of baby clothes that left exposed two very small brown
feet, and two very small brown hands&mdash;nothing more.</p>

<p class="indent">The child's head had been torn off!</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">There is also the story of O-Kamé, who returned each
night to haunt her husband; of Ch&#363;gor&#333;, who was bewitched
by a beautiful woman whom he married beneath
the waters. But he sickened and died, for his blood had
been drained by his Circe, who was "simply a Frog,&mdash;a
great and ugly Frog!"</p>

<p class="indent">The literature and the significance of the fire-flies holds
an important place with the Japanese, and for more than
a thousand years the poets have been making verses about
these little creatures.</p>

<p class="indent">A sketch in which Hearn is most fortunate is "Pathological,"
where Tama, the mother-cat, dreams of her dead
kittens&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">Yet those countless solar fires, with their viewless millions of living
planets, must somehow reappear: again the wondrous Cosmos, self-born
as self-consumed, must resume its sidereal whirl over the deeps
of the eternities. And the love that strives for ever with death shall
rise again, through fresh infinitudes of pain, to renew the everlasting
battle.</p>

<p class="indent">The light of the mother's smile will survive our sun;&mdash;the thrill of
her kiss will last beyond the thrilling of stars;&mdash;the sweetness of her
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;234]</span>
lullaby will endure in the cradle-songs of worlds yet unevolved;&mdash;the
tenderness of her faith will quicken the fervour of prayers to be made
to the hosts of another heaven,&mdash;to the gods of a time beyond Time.
And the nectar of her breasts can never fail: that snowy stream will
still flow on, to nourish the life of some humanity more perfect than
our own, when the Milky Way that spans our night shall have
vanished for ever out of Space.</p>

<p>Like unto the Soul is a Drop of Dew for</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">Your personality signifies, in the eternal order, just as much as the
especial motion of molecules in the shivering of any single drop.
Perhaps in no other drop will the thrilling and the picturing be ever

and there will always be quivering pictures.... The very delusion

was published after Hearn's death. It is a collection of
old stories, many of them of the gruesome, and of careful
studies of ants, mosquitoes, and butterflies. Striking is
the tale of Yuki-Onna, the snow-woman, as is also the
incident of Riki-Baka. One bewitched by the dead is
Mimi-Nashi-H&#333;ïchi, whose ears were torn off because the
holy texts which were written everywhere else upon his
body were there forgotten. Sonj&#333;, the hunter, killed the
mate of a female <i>oshidori</i>, who after appearing to him in a
dream as a beautiful woman, who rebukes him the following
day as a bird, tears open her body, and dies before his
eyes. O-Tei is reborn in the shape of a woman that she
may wed years later her promised husband&mdash;Nagao Ch&#333;sei
of Echigo. So loyal is the love of O-Sodé, the milk-nurse,
that the cherry-tree which is planted in commemoration
of her, on the anniversary of her death, blossoms in a
wonderful way. Because of his selfish wickedness in
thinking only of the gains in his profession, a priest was
made to be reborn into the state of a <i>jikininki</i>, who had
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;235]</span>
to devour the corpses of people who died in his district.
Other devourers of human flesh are the Rokuro-Kubi.
The head of a Rokuro-Kubi separates itself from its
body.</p>

</blockquote>

<p class="indent">"The history of Japan is really the history of her
religion," is the key to the book.</p>

<p class="indent">The <i>Academy</i> remarks:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">"No one who wishes to understand the possibilities of
the future of Japan can afford to neglect the past, and no
one who would grasp the meaning of the past can afford
to neglect Mr. Hearn's fine and thoughtful work." (288.)</p>

<p class="indent">In a review Mr. Griffis says:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">"They felt that he had done his best and was degenerating.
Yet here is a work which is a classic in science,
a wonder of interpretation. It is the product of long
years of thought, of keenest perception, or marvellous
comprehension.</p>

<p class="indent">"One cannot quote, one must read this work. It shows
the Japanese under his armour, modern science. The
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;236]</span>
Japanese, outwardly, are ruled by treaties, diplomacy,
governments, codes, Imperial Diet, armies and battleships&mdash;all
modern and external. Inwardly they&mdash;that is, forty-nine
millions of them&mdash;are governed by ghosts. The
graveyard is the true dictator. It is ever their 'illustrious
ancestors' who achieve victories. They, as a nation, are
superbly organized for war. There is no originality, no
personality, no individuality worth speaking of in the
island empire. It is all done by the government, the
community. In social evolution the Japanese are even
yet far behind the Romans, and much as the pre-Homeric
Greeks.</p>

<p class="indent">"In a word, Lafcadio Hearn outdoes the missionaries in
dogmatism, exceeds even the hostile propagandist in telling
the naked truth. Devoted friend of Japan, he excels the
sworn enemies of her religions in laying bare, though with
admiration, the realities.... Lafcadio Hearn turns the
white and searching beams on the ship and man....
His book is a re-reading of all Japanese history, a sociological
appraisement of the value of Japanese civilization,
and a warning against intolerant propaganda of any sort
whatever. This book is destined to live, and to cause
searchings of heart among those who imagine that the
Japanese soul has been changed in fifty years." (326.)</p>

<p class="indent">From the <i>Spectator</i> I quote:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">"Both the prose and poetry of Japanese life are infused
into Mr. Hearn's charming pages. Nobody, so far as we
know, has given a better description of the fascination
which Japanese life has at first for such as enter into its
true spirit, and of its gradual disappearance.... Of course
it must be remembered that this charm of Japan was
something more than a beautiful mirage. 'Old Japan,' in
the opinion of Mr. Hearn, 'came nearer to the achievement
of the highest moral ideal than our far more evolved
societies can hope to do for many a hundred years.
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;237]</span>
Curiously enough, it was under the shadow of the sword
that the fascinating life of Japan matured; universal
politeness was nurtured by the knowledge that any act of
rudeness might, and probably would, cause a painful and
immediate death. This supremacy of the sword, governed
by the noble rule of <i>bushi-do</i>, hardened the Japanese
temper into the wonderful spirit of self-sacrifice and patriotism
which is now making itself apparent in the stress of
war. All this is admirably portrayed in Mr. Hearn's pages,&mdash;the
swan-song of a very striking writer." (383.)</p>

<p class="indent">In <i>The American Journal of Sociology</i> there is a review
of this book, by Edmund Buckley of the University of
Chicago, which is so admirable and inclusive that I have
obtained Professor Buckley's kind permission to quote it
in its entirety. This review leaves small margin for further
comment. But it is to be regretted that space will not
permit citations of Hearn's tributes to the Japanese home,
woman and character.</p>

<p class="indent">"On p. 160 of W. E. Griffis' 'The Mikado's Empire,' is
textual evidence that, so late as 1876, intelligent men, and
theologians at that&mdash;rather, in sooth, because they are
theologians&mdash;could harbour such atrocious notions about
Shint&#333;ism, the ethnic faith of the Japanese, as the following:
'Shint&#333; is in no proper sense of the term a religion.... In
its lower forms it is blind obedience to governmental and
priestly dictates.' The present reviewer bears these Christian
apologists and heathen defamers 'witness that they have
a zeal for God, but not according to knowledge.' They
wrote in the days when hierology (comparative religion)
was still inchoate, for C. P. Ticle's 'Elements' did not
appear in its English dress until 1877; and when Japan's
abasement before the 'Christian' powers was complete,
and therefore everything Japanese assumed to be worthless.
But the reaction came, of course, and is now pretty well
completed. Japan's novel yet glorious art conquered the
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;238]</span>
world; Japan's new yet ever-victorious army has conquered
Russia's imposing array; and now Mr. Hearn completely
routs the contemners of a people's sincere faith. The
consensus of hierologists that no people was ever found
without a religion had already been given; and the creed,
cult, and ethics of Shint&#333;ism had been correctly described;
but it remained for Mr. Hearn to give a more complete and
intimate account than had previously been done of the
ancestorism in Shint&#333; and of its profound influence upon
politics and morality.</p>

<p class="indent">"It will surprise no one to learn that Mr. Hearn overdid
his contention, just because such excess is the well-nigh
inevitable reaction from the underestimate that he found
current and sought to correct. As he states the case on
p. 4: 'Hitherto the subject of Japanese religion has been
written of chiefly by the sworn enemies of that religion;
by others it has been almost entirely ignored.' But now
that 'see-saw' has followed 'see,' we may hope to win a
final equilibrium of correct appreciation. To this end
several corrections are called for; but, before they are
made, clearness will be secured by a concise analysis of
the treatise; for in its course religion, politics, and morality
are interwoven on a historic warp. The entire fabric runs
about as follows: (Chap. 3.) The real religion of the
Japanese is ancestorism, which showed in three cults&mdash;the
domestic, the communal, and the state. The domestic
arose first, but the primitive family might include hundreds
of households. Ancestorism in Japan confirms Spencer's
exposition of religious origins. The greater gods were all
evolved from ghost-cults. Good men made good gods;
bad men, bad ones. (Chap. 4.) The domestic cult began
in offerings of food and drink made at the grave; then,
under Chinese influence, was transferred to the home before
tablets; where it was maintained until this present by
Buddhism. Thin tablets of white wood, inscribed with
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;239]</span>
the names of the dead, are placed in a miniature wooden
shrine, which is kept upon a shelf in some inner chamber.
Tiny offerings of food, accompanied with brief prayer,
must be made each day by some member of the household
in behalf of all; for the blessed dead still need sustenance,
and in return can guard the house. The Buddhist rite,
however, made prayer, not <i>to</i>, but <i>for</i> these dead. The
Japanese scholar Hirata is correct when he declares the
worship of ancestors to be the mainspring of all virtues.
(Chap. 5.) The family was united only by religion. The
father&mdash;not the mother&mdash;was supposed to be the life-giver,
and was therefore responsible for the cult. Hence the
inferior position of woman. The ancestral ghost of an <i>uji</i>,
or family of several households, became later the <i>ujigami</i>,
or local tutelar god. Subordination of young to old, of
females to males, and of the whole family to its chief, who
was at once ruler and priest, shows that the family organization
was religious and not marital. Both monogamy and
the practice of parents selecting their child's spouse arose
because best accordant with religion. Later custom makes
the decision, not of the father alone, but of the household
and kindred, determinative of any important step.</p>

<p class="indent">"(Chap. 6.) The communal cult of the district ruled the
family in all its relations to the outer world. The <i>ujigami</i>,
or clan-god, was the spirit rather of a former ruler than of
a common ancestor. Hochiman was a ruler, but Kasuga
an ancestor. Beside the <i>uji</i> temple of a district, there may
be a more important one dedicated to some higher deity.
Every <i>ujiko</i> or parishioner is taken to the <i>ujigami</i> when
one month old and dedicated to him. Thereafter he
attends the temple festivals, which combine fun with piety;
and he makes the temple groves his playground. Grown
up, he brings his children here; and, if he leaves home,
pays his respects to the god on leaving and returning.
Thus the social bond of each community was identical
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;240]</span>
with the religious bond, and the cult of the <i>ujigami</i>
embodied the moral experience of the community. The
individual of such a community enjoyed only a narrowly
restricted liberty. Shint&#333;ism had no moral code, because
at this stage of ancestor-cult religion and ethics coincide.</p>

<p class="indent">"(Chap. 7.) The great gods of nature were developed
from ancestor-worship, though their real history has been
long forgotten. (Chap. 8.) Rites of worship and of purification
were many. (Chap. 9.) The rule of the dead
extended to moral conduct and even to sumptuary matters,
language, and amusements. (Chap. 10.) Buddhism absorbed
the native ancestor-cult, but prescribed that prayers
be said for them, not to them. In accordance with its
principle, 'First observe the person, then preach the law'&mdash;that
is, accommodate instruction to the hearer's capacity&mdash;Buddhism
taught the masses metempsychosis instead of
palingenesis, and the paradise of Amida instead of the
nirvâna of Buddha. Buddhism rendered its greatest
service to Japan by education in the learning and arts of
China. (Chap. 11.) The higher Buddhism is a kind of
monism.</p>

<p class="indent">"(Chap. 12.) Japanese society was simply an amplification
of the patriarchal family, and its clan-groups never
united into a coherent body until 1871. At first the bulk
of the people were slaves or serfs, but from the seventh
century a large class of freedmen&mdash;farmers and artisans&mdash;came
into existence. The first period of Japanese
social evolution was based on a national head, the Mikado,
and a national cult, Shint&#333;ism; it began in this seventh
century, but developed to the limit of its type only
under the Tokugawa shoguns, in the seventeenth
century.</p>

<p class="indent">"Next to the priest-emperor at the head came the <i>kugé</i>,
or ancient nobility, from whose ranks most of the latter
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;241]</span>
regents and shoguns were drawn. Next ranked the <i>buké</i>
or <i>samurai</i>, which was the professional military class, and
was ruled by nearly three hundred <i>daimy&#333;</i>, or feudal lords
of varying importance. Next came the commonalty,
<i>heimin</i>, with three classes&mdash;farmers, artisans, and tradesmen,
the last being despised by the <i>samurai</i>, who also could cut
down any disrespectful <i>heimin</i> with impunity. Lowest of
all came the <i>chori</i>&mdash;pariahs, who were not counted Japanese
at all, but <i>mono</i>-'things.' But even among them distinctions
arose according to occupation. The close care taken
of the native religion by the government precluded rise of
a church. Nor was Buddhism, divided into hostile sects
and opposed by the <i>samurai</i>, ever able to establish a
hierarchy independent of the government. Personal freedom
was suppressed, as it would be now under Socialism,
which is simply a reversion to an overcome type.</p>

<p class="indent">"(Chap. 13.) The second period of Japanese social
evolution lasted from the eleventh to the nineteenth century,
and was marked by dominance over the mikadoate of
successive dynasties of shoguns. The permanence of this
mikadoate amid all perturbations of the shogunate was
owing to its religious nature. (Chap. 14.) Following the
lord in death, suicide, and vendetta were customs based on
loyalty, and they involved the noblest self-sacrifice. (Chap.
15.) Catholic missions were suppressed lest they should
lead to the political conquest of Japan. (Chap. 16.) The
Tokugawa shoguns exercised iron discipline, and now were
brought to perfection those exquisite arts and manners of
the Japanese. (Chap. 17.) A revival of learning, begun
in the eighteenth century, slowly led to a new nationalist
support of the Mikado; and when by 1891 the shogun had
resigned and the daimiates been abolished, the third period
in Japan's social evolution began. (Chap. 18.) In spite
of outward seeming, the ancient social conditions and
ancestor-cult still control every action. (Chap. 19.) The
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;242]</span>
individual is still restrained by the conventions of the
masses, by communistic guilds of craftsmen, and by
the government's practice of taking loyal service in all
its departments without giving adequate pecuniary reward.
(Chap. 20.) The educational system still maintains the old
communism by training, not for individual ability, but for
co-operative action. This is favoured, too, by the universal
practice of rich men meeting the personal expenses of
promising students. (Chap. 21.) Japanese loyalty and
courage will support her army and navy, but industrial
competition with other peoples calls for individual freedom.
(Chap. 22.) The Japanese are not indifferent to
religion, and can be understood only by a study of their
religious and social evolution. Future changes will be social,
but ancestor-cult will persist, and offers an insuperable
obstacle to the spread of Christianity.</p>

<p class="indent">"The critical reader will not have failed to meet in
this summary many positions that challenge his previous
knowledge, and whether these be correct or not can be
determined only by an examination of the full text,
which it eminently deserves. The reviewer, however, will
confine himself to certain matters that seem to him the
dominating errors of the whole. Probably three greater
errors were never compressed into a single sentence than
in this from p. 27: 'The real religion of Japan, the religion
still professed in one form or another by the entire nation,
is that cult which has been the foundation of all civilized
religion and of all civilized society&mdash;ancestor-worship.'
That ancestor-worship is still professed by the entire
nation is negatived by all we know from other sources as
well as all we should expect. The ancestor-worship
native to Japan had been appropriated by Buddhism;
and, since the revolution of 1868 with its disestablishment
of that church, the Butsudan, where the tablets
were kept, has been largely sold as an art object or
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;243]</span>
has been simply disused. The <i>mitamaya</i> mentioned on
p. 50, as if in extensive use for ancestor-worship, is found
only in a few purist families, and is known to the mass of
Japanese only as the rear apartment or structure of a
Shint&#333;ist shrine.</p>

<p class="indent">"That ancestor-worship is 'the real religion of Japan'
and 'has been the foundation of all civilized religion' are
errors that Mr. Hearn owes to Herbert Spencer's influence,
which is confessed here, and indeed is evident throughout
the work. Perhaps nothing has brought Spencer into
more discredit than the lengths he went to prove this
basic nature of ancestorism in his 'Principles of Sociology,'
and the reader of pp. 121-24 of Mr. Hearn's work will
readily see how futile also is the attempt to show that the
nature-deities of Shint&#333;ism were only 'transfigured ghosts.'
No, indeed, God did not make man and leave ghosts to
make him religious. The heaven and the earth were here
before ghosts, and man could personify them just as soon
as he knew himself as a person, which he must have done
long before he analyzed himself into a ghost-soul and a
body. Had Mr. Hearn not ignored Réville, Max Müller,
Pfleiderer, and Saussaye, while steeping himself in Spencer,
he might have observed, what is plainly visible in Shint&#333;ism
as elsewhere: that religion has <i>two</i> tap roots, ancestorism
indeed, but also naturism.</p>

<p class="indent">"Again, Mr. Hearn's sentence declares that ancestor-worship
is 'the foundation of all civilized society.' This
is the prevailing view throughout the work; for example,
on pp. 23, 57, 86, 99, 175, and 320. But other passages
imply the saner view that religion and morality are coordinate
functions of one man. Thus at p. 511, Mr. Hearn
attributes Japan's power to 'her old religious and social
training.' The many and strong cases of influence of religion
upon conduct that can really be shown in Japan
amount only to influence, of course, and not to 'foundation'
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;244]</span>
or 'origination,' A quite transparent case of Mr. Hearn's
error is where (p. 152) he attributes the exceptional cleanliness
of the Japanese to their religion, which here, as usual,
he sums up as ancestor-worship. One wonders, however,
why this world-wide phenomenon of religion should determine
a Japanese cleanliness; why ancestor-worshippers
are not always clean; as for example the Chinese, who
bathe most rarely. It seems saner to seek a cause for
the unique daily bath of the Japanese in their also uniquely
numerous thermal springs, which occur in no less than 388
different localities. Symbolism did indeed in Japan, as
elsewhere, lead to religious bathing in rivers; but bathing
in rivers, as in ocean, was never popular in Japan until
recently learned from the foreigner; whereas the thermal
springs are crowded, and the daily baths at home are
always taken exceedingly hot after the thermal pattern,
for these have been found not only cleansing, but curing
and warming, the last quality being a great merit where
winters are cold and houses unheated.</p>

<p class="indent">"Finally, the reader need not expect to meet here any
adequate reference to those vices that have been fostered
by religion in Japan. The concubinage, confirmed by
ancestorism, is once mentioned; and the harlotry, promoted
by phallicism (the phallos was frequently found in a brothel,
though not exclusively there, of course), is relegated to a
simple footnote. But such matters can be learned elsewhere,
whereas the close and frequent points of influence
which religion exercised upon politics and morality in Japan
can nowhere else be so well studied as here." (292.)</p>

Hearn's posthumous book. The last memories are of
the "Weaving Lady of the Milky Way"; of "Goblin
Poetry"; of "Ultimate Questions," which are called forth
by the essay of that name written by the author of the
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;245]</span>
"Synthetic Philosophy"; of the "Mirror Maiden" whom
Matsumura, the priest, saved from the well, and who repaid
him by good-fortune. Moreover, of the alluring maiden
in the dream of It&#333; Norisuké&mdash;if one is to choose a ghost
for a bride, who would not seek Himégimi-Sama? As a
finale there is the picture of Admiral T&#333;g&#333; sending to
T&#333;ky&#333; "for some flowering-trees in pots&mdash;inasmuch as
his responsibilities allowed him no chance of seeing the
cherry-flowers and the plum-blossoms in their season."</p>

<p class="indent">While engaged upon this little mosaic work of legend and fable,
I felt much like one of those merchants told of in Sindbad's Second
Voyage, who were obliged to content themselves with gathering the
small jewels adhering to certain meat which eagles brought up from
the Valley of Diamonds. I have had to depend altogether upon the
labour of translators for my acquisitions; and these seemed too small
to deserve separate literary setting. By cutting my little gems according
to one pattern, I have doubtless reduced the beauty of some; yet
it seemed to me their colours were so weird, their luminosity so elfish,
that their intrinsic value could not be wholly destroyed even by so
clumsy an artificer as I.</p>

<p class="indent">In short, these fables, legends, parables, etc., are simply reconstructions
of what impressed me as most fantastically beautiful in the
most exotic literature which I was able to obtain. With few exceptions,
the plans of the original narratives have been preserved....</p>

<p class="indent">This little collection has no claim upon the consideration of scholars.
It is simply an attempt to share with the public some of those novel
delights I experienced while trying to familiarize myself with some
very strange and beautiful literatures.</p>

<p class="indent">... My gems were few and small: the
monstrous and splendid await the coming of Sindbad, or some mighty
lapidary by whom they may be wrought into jewel bouquets exquisite
as those bunches of topaz blossoms and ruby buds laid upon the tomb
of Nourmahal.</p>

<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;255]</span>

<p class="indent">8vo., 6 p. l., pp. 42, brown cloth, design on cover.</p>

<p class="indent">(3-4) Introduction (<i>Extract</i>).</p>

<p class="indent">Any one who has ever paid a flying visit to New Orleans probably
knows something about those various culinary preparations whose
generic name is "Gombo"&mdash;compounded of many odds and ends, with
the okra-plant, or true gombo for a basis, but also comprising occasionally
"losé, zepinard, laitie," and the other vegetables sold in bunches
in the French market. At all events, any person who has remained in
the city for a season must have become familiar with the nature of
"gombo filé," "gombo févi," and "gombo aux herbes," or as our
coloured cook calls it "gombo zhèbes"&mdash;for she belongs to the older
generation of Creole <i>cuisinières</i>, and speaks the patois in its primitive
purity, without using a single "r." Her daughter, who has been to
school, would pronounce it <i>gombo zhairbes</i>:&mdash;the modern patois is
becoming more and more Frenchified, and will soon be altogether
forgotten, not only throughout Louisiana, but even in the Antilles. It
still, however, retains originality enough to be understood with difficulty
by persons thoroughly familiar with French; and even those
who know nothing of any language but English, readily recognize it
by the peculiar rapid syllabification and musical intonation. Such
English-speaking residents of New Orleans seldom speak of it as
"Creole": they call it <i>gombo</i>, for some mysterious reason which I
have never been able to explain satisfactorily. The coloured Creoles
of the city have themselves begun to use the term to characterize the
patois spoken by the survivors of slavery days. Turiault tells us that
in the town of Martinique, where the Creole is gradually changing
into French, the <i>Bitacos</i>, or country negroes who still speak the patois
nearly pure, are much ridiculed by their municipal brethren:&mdash;<i>Ça ou
ka palé là, chè, c'est nèg;&mdash;Ça pas Créole!</i> ("What you talk is
'nigger,' my dear:&mdash;that isn't Creole!") In like manner a young
Creole negro or negress of New Orleans might tell an aged member
of his race: <i>Ça qui to parlé ça pas Créole; ça c'est gombo!</i> I have
sometimes heard the pure and primitive Creole also called "Congo"
by coloured folks of the new generation.</p>

<p class="indent">The literature of "gombo" has perhaps even more varieties than
there are preparations of the esculents above referred to;&mdash;the patois
has certainly its gombo févi, its gombo filé, its "gombo zhèbes"&mdash;both
written and unwritten. A work like Marbot's "Bambous" would
deserve to be classed with the pure "févi";&mdash;the treatises of Turiault,
Baissac, St. Quentin, Thomas, rather resemble that fully prepared dish,
in which crabs seem to struggle with fragments of many well-stewed
meats, all strongly seasoned with pepper. The present essay at
Creole folklore, can only be classed as "gombo zhèbes"&mdash;(<i>Zhèbes çé
feuil-chou, cresson, laitie, bettrav, losé, zepinard</i>); the true okra is not
the basis of our preparation;&mdash;it is a Creole dish, if you please, but a
salmagundi of inferior quality.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;256]</span>
Needless to say, this collection is far from perfect;&mdash;the most
I can hope for is that it may constitute the nucleus of a more exhaustive
publication to appear in course of time. No one person
could hope to make a really complete collection of Creole proverbs&mdash;even
with all the advantages of linguistic knowledge, leisure, wealth,
and travel. Only a society of folklorists might bring such an undertaking
to a successful issue;&mdash;but as no systematic effort is being
made in this direction, I have had no hesitation in attempting&mdash;not
indeed to fill a want&mdash;but to set an example. <i>Gouïe passé, difil
sivré</i>:&mdash;let the needle but pass, the thread will follow.</p>

<p class="indent">I think that my best apology for the insignificant size of this
volume is the very character of the material composing it. In preparing
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;257]</span>
the legends I sought especially for <i>weird beauty</i>; and I could
not forget this striking observation in Sir Walter Scott's "Essay on
Imitations of the Ancient Ballad": "The supernatural, though
appealing to certain powerful emotions very widely and deeply sown
amongst the human race, is, nevertheless, <i>a spring which is peculiarly
apt to lose its elasticity by being too much pressed upon</i>." Those
desirous to familiarize themselves with Chinese literature as a whole
have had the way made smooth for them by the labours of linguists
like Julien, Pavie, Rémusat, De Rosny, Schlegel, Legge, Hervey-Saint-Denys,
Williams, Biot, Giles, Wylie, Beal, and many other
Sinologists. To such great explorers indeed, the realm of Cathayan
story belongs by right of discovery and conquest; yet the humbler
traveller who follows wonderingly after them into the vast and
mysterious pleasure-grounds of Chinese fancy may surely be permitted
to cull a few of the marvellous flowers there growing,&mdash;a
self-luminous <i>hwa-wang</i>, a black lily, a phosphoric rose or two,&mdash;as
souvenirs of his curious voyage.</p>

<p class="indent">But the rare charm of Japanese life, so different from that of all
other lands, is not to be found in its Europeanized circles. It is to be
found among the great common people, who represent in Japan, as in
all countries, the national virtues, and who still cling to their delightful
old customs, their picturesque dresses, their Buddhist images, their
household shrines, their beautiful and touching worship of ancestors.
This is the life of which a foreign observer can never weary, if
fortunate and sympathetic enough to enter into it,&mdash;the life that forces
him sometimes to doubt whether the course of our boasted Western
progress is really in the direction of moral development. Each day,
while the years pass, there will be revealed to him some strange and
unsuspected beauty in it. Like other life, it has its darker side; yet
even this is brightness compared with the darker side of Western
existence. It has its foibles, its follies, its vices, its cruelties; yet the
more one sees of it, the more one marvels at its extraordinary goodness,
its miraculous patience, its never-failing courtesy, its simplicity
of heart, its intuitive charity. And to our own larger Occidental
comprehension, its commonest superstitions, however contemned at
T&#333;ky&#333;, have rarest value as fragments of the unwritten literature of its
hopes, its fears, its experience with right and wrong,&mdash;its primitive
efforts to find solutions for the riddle of the Unseen.</p>

<p class="indent">All but one of the papers composing this volume appear for the
first time. The little essays, or rather fantasies, forming the second
part of the book, deal with experiences in two hemispheres; but their
general title should explain why they have been arranged independently
of that fact. To any really scientific imagination, the curious
analogy existing between certain teachings of evolutional psychology
and certain teachings of Eastern faith,&mdash;particularly the Buddhist
doctrine that all sense-life is Karma, and all substance only the phenomenal
result of acts and thoughts,&mdash;might have suggested something
much more significant than my cluster of "Retrospectives."
These are offered merely as intimations of a truth incomparably less
difficult to recognize than to define.</p>

<p class="indent">(3) Prefatory Note:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">Most of the following <i>Kwaidan</i>, or Weird Tales, have been taken
from old Japanese books,&mdash;such as the <i>Yas&#333;-Kidan</i>, <i>Bukky&#333;-Hyakkwa-Zensh&#333;</i>,
<i>Kokon-Chomonsh&#363;</i>, <i>Tama-Sudaré</i> and <i>Hyaku-Monogatari</i>.
Some of the stories may have had a Chinese origin: the very
remarkable "Dream of Akinosuké," for example, is certainly from a
Chinese source. But the Japanese story-teller in every case, has so
recoloured and reshaped his borrowing as to naturalize it.... One
queer tale, "Yuki-Onna," was told me by a farmer of Ch&#333;fu, Nishitamag&#333;ri,
in Musashi province, as a legend of his native village. Whether it
has even been written in Japanese I do not know; but the extraordinary
belief which it records used certainly to exist in most parts of Japan,
and in many curious forms.... The incident of "Riki-Baka" was

<p class="indent">It is the artist, therefore, who must judge of Gautier's creations.
To the lovers of the loveliness of the antique world, the lovers of
physical beauty and artistic truth,&mdash;of the charm of youthful dreams
and young passion in its blossoming,&mdash;of poetic ambitions and the
sweet pantheism that finds all Nature vitalized by the Spirit of the
Beautiful,&mdash;to such the first English version of these graceful fantasies
is offered in the hope that it may not be found wholly unworthy of the
original.</p>

<p class="indent">But it is not because M. Anatole France has rare power to create
original characters, or to reflect for us something of the more recondite
literary life of Paris, that his charming story will live. It is because of
his far rarer power to deal with what is older than any art, and withal
more young, and incomparably more precious: the beauty of what is
beautiful in human emotion. And that writer who touches the spring
of generous tears by some simple story of gratitude, of natural kindness,
of gentle self-sacrifice, is surely more entitled to our love than
the sculptor who shapes for us a dream of merely animal grace, or the
painter who images for us, however richly, the young bloom of that
form which is only the husk of Being.<span class="ralign">L. H.</span></p>

<p class="center">No. 281.</p>

<p class="indent">1885. AVATAR. Par Gautier, Translation by Lafcadio Hearn.
Unable to find a publisher, Hearn destroyed the manuscript.</p>

<p class="center">No. 282.</p>

<p class="indent">THE TEMPTATION OF ST. ANTHONY, by Gustave Flaubert;
translated from the Fifth Paris Edition, Vols. I-II. (Manuscript copy
in the possession of Dr. Gould.) The half-page containing, at one
time, probably, the translator's name, is cut off. The title-page is
preceded by a half-page, printed, of directions to the printer, regarding
size of type, etc.</p>

<p class="indent">The volumes are 6 x 9-1/2 inches, opening at the end. The writing
is in pencil, and the letters large, even for an ordinary handwriting,
but remarkably so for that of Hearn, who, when writing with a pen,
made his letters very small. The paper has the yellow tint habitually
used by him.</p>

<p class="indent">Volume I contains 364 pages; Volume II, numbered consecutively,
the balance of a total of 679 pages. Five pages of <i>addenda</i> follow,
containing notes upon passages, with original texts, etc., which the
American publisher would hardly dare to put forth.</p>

<p class="indent">Hearn's synopsis (printed) of the "St. Anthony" accompanies the
text of the translation, and is reproduced herewith:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">ARGUMENT</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Frailty</span></p>

<p class="indent">Sunset in the desert. Enfeebled by prolonged fasting, the hermit
finds himself unable to concentrate his mind upon holy things. His
thoughts wander: memories of youth evoke regrets that his relaxed
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;288]</span>
will can no longer find strength to suppress;&mdash;and, remembrance
begetting remembrance, his fancy leads him upon dangerous ground.
He dreams of his flight from home,&mdash;of Ammonaria, his sister's
playmate,&mdash;of his misery in the waste,&mdash;his visit to Alexandria with
the blind monk Didymus,&mdash;the unholy sights of the luxurious city.</p>

<p class="indent">Involuntarily he yields to the nervous dissatisfaction growing upon
him. He laments his solitude, his joylessness, his poverty, the
obscurity of his life: grace departs from him; hope burns low within
his heart. Suddenly revolting against his weakness, he seeks refuge
from distraction in the study of the Scriptures.</p>

<p class="indent">Vain effort! An invisible hand turns the leaves, placing perilous
texts before his eyes. He dreams of the Maccabees slaughtering
their enemies, and desires that he might do likewise with the
Arians of Alexandria;&mdash;he becomes inspired with admiration of
King Nebuchadnezzar;&mdash;he meditates voluptuously upon the visit of
Sheba's queen to Solomon;&mdash;discovers a text in the Acts of the
Apostles antagonistic to principles of monkish asceticism,&mdash;indulges
in reveries regarding the riches of the Biblical Kings and holy men.
The Tempter comes to tempt him with evil hallucinations for which
the Saint's momentary frailty has paved the way; and with the Evil
One comes also&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Seven Deadly Sins</span></p>

<p class="indent">Phantom gold is piled up to excite Covetousness; shadowy banquets
appear to evoke Gluttony. The scene shifts to aid the temptations of
Anger and of Pride....</p>

<p class="indent">Anthony finds himself in Alexandria, at the head of a wild army of
monks slaughtering the heretics and the pagans, without mercy for
age or sex. In fantastic obedience to the course of his fancy while
reading the Scriptures a while before, and like an invisible echo of
his evil thoughts, the scene changes again. Alexandria is transformed
into Constantinople.</p>

<p class="indent">Anthony finds himself the honoured of the Emperor. He beholds
the vast circus in all its splendour, the ocean of faces, the tumult of
excitement. Simultaneously he beholds his enemies degraded to
the condition of slaves, toiling in the stables of Constantine. He
feels joy in the degradation of the Fathers of Nicæa. Then all is
transformed.</p>

<p class="indent">It is no longer the splendour of Constantinople he beholds under
the luminosity of a Greek day; but the prodigious palace of
Nebuchadnezzar by night. He beholds the orgies, the luxuries, the
abominations;&mdash;and the spirit of Pride enters triumphantly into him
as the spirit of Nebuchadnezzar....</p>

<p class="indent">Awakening as from a dream, he finds himself again before his
hermitage. A vast caravan approaches, halts; and the Queen of
Sheba descends to tempt the Saint with the deadliest of all temptations.
Her beauty is enhanced by Oriental splendour of adornment;
her converse is a song of witchcraft. The Saint remains firm....
The Seven Deadly Sins depart from him.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;289]</span>
<span class="smcap">The Heresiarchs</span></p>

<p class="indent">But now the Tempter assumes a subtler form. Under the guise of
a former disciple of Anthony,&mdash;Hilarion,&mdash;the demon, while pretending
to seek instruction seeks to poison the mind of Anthony with
hatred of the fathers of the church. He repeats all the scandals
amassed by ecclesiastical intriguers, all the calumnies created by
malice;&mdash;he cites texts only to foment doubt, and quotes the Evangels
only to make confusion. Under the pretext of obtaining mental
enlightenment from the wisest of men, he induces Anthony to enter
with him into a spectral basilica, wherein are assembled all the
Heresiarchs of the third century. The hermit is confounded by the
multitude of tenets,&mdash;horrified by the blasphemies and abominations
of Elkes, Corpocrates, Valentinus, Manes, Cerdo,&mdash;disgusted by the
perversions of the Paternians, Marcosians, Serpentians,&mdash;bewildered
by the apocryphal Gospels of Eve and of Judas, of the Lord and of
Thomas.</p>

<p class="indent">And Hilarion grows taller.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Martyrs</span></p>

<p class="indent">Anthony finds himself in the dungeons of a vast amphitheatre,
among Christians condemned to the wild beasts. By this hallucination
the tempter would prove to the Saint that martyrdom is not
always suffered for purest motives. Anthony finds the martyrs
possessed of bigotry and insincerity. He sees many compelled to die
against their will; many who would forswear their faith could it avail
them aught. He beholds heretics die for their heterodoxy more nobly
than orthodox believers.</p>

<p class="indent">He finds himself transported to the tombs of the martyrs. He
witnesses the meeting of Christian women at the sepulchres. He
beholds the touching ceremonies of prayer change into orgie,&mdash;lamentations
give place to amorous dalliance.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Magicians</span></p>

<p class="indent">Then the Tempter seeks to shake Anthony's faith in the excellence
and evidence of miracles. He assumes the form of a Hindoo
Brahmin, terminating a life of wondrous holiness by self-cremation;&mdash;he
appears as Simon Magus and Helen of Tyre,&mdash;as Apollonius of
Tyana, greatest of all thaumaturgists, who claim superiority to Christ.
All the marvels related by Philostratus are embodied in the converse
of Apollonius and Damis.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Gods</span></p>

<p class="indent">Hilarion reappears, taller than ever, growing more gigantic in
proportion to the increasing weakness of the Saint. Standing beside
Anthony he evokes all the deities of the antique world. They defile
before him a marvellous panorama;&mdash;Gods of Egypt and India,
Chaldæa and Hellas, Babylon and Ultima Thule,&mdash;monstrous and
multiform, phallic and ithyphallic, fantastic and obscene. Some
intoxicate by their beauty; others appal by their foulness. The
Buddha recounts the story of his wondrous life; Venus displays the
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;290]</span>
rounded daintiness of her nudity; Isis utters awful soliloquy. Lastly
the phantom of Jehovah appears, as the shadow of a god passing
away for ever.</p>

<p class="indent">Suddenly the stature of Hilarion towers to the stars; he assumes
the likeness and luminosity of Lucifer; he announces himself as&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Science</span></p>

<p class="indent">And Anthony is lifted upon mighty wings and borne away beyond
the world, above the solar system, above the starry arch of the Milky
Way. All future discoveries of Astronomy are revealed to him. He
is tempted by the revelation of innumerable worlds,&mdash;by the refutation
of all his previous ideas of the nature of the Universe,&mdash;by the
enigmas of infinity,&mdash;by all the marvels that conflict with faith. Even
in the night of the Immensity the demon renews the temptation of
reason; Anthony wavers upon the verge of pantheism.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Lust and Death</span></p>

<p class="indent">Anthony, abandoned by the Spirit of Science, comes to himself in
the desert. Then the Tempter returns under a two-fold aspect: as
the Spirit of Fornication and the Spirit of Destruction. The latter
urges him to suicide,&mdash;the former to indulgence of sense. They
inspire him with strong fancies of palingenesis, of the illusion of
death, of the continuity of life. The pantheistic temptation intensifies.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Monsters</span></p>

<p class="indent">Anthony in reveries meditates upon the monstrous symbols painted
upon the walls of certain ancient temples. Could he know their
meaning he might learn also something of the secret lien between
Matter and Thought. Forthwith a phantasmagoria of monsters
commence to pass before his eyes:&mdash;the Sphinx and the Chimera, the
Blemmyes and Astomi, the Cynocephali and all creatures of mythologic
creation. He beholds the fabulous beings of Oriental imagining,&mdash;the
abnormities described by Pliny and Herodotus,&mdash;the fantasticalities
to be adopted later by heraldry,&mdash;the grotesqueries of future
mediæval illumination made animate;&mdash;the goblinries and foulnesses
of superstitious fancy,&mdash;the Witches' Sabbath of abominations.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Metamorphosis</span></p>

<p class="indent">The multitude of monsters melts away; the land changes into an
Ocean; the creatures of the briny abysses appear. And the waters
in turn also change; seaweeds are transformed to herbs, forests of
coral give place to forests of trees, polypous life changes to vegetation.
Metals crystallize; frosts effloresce, plants become living things, inanimate
matter takes animate form, monads vibrate, the pantheism of
nature makes itself manifest. Anthony feels a delirious desire to
unite himself with the Spirit of Universal Being....</p>

<p class="indent">The vision vanishes. The sun arises. The face of Christ is
revealed. The temptation has passed; Anthony kneels in prayer.</p>

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
